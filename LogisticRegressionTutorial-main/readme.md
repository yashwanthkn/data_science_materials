# Logistic Regression Tutorial Notebok

Welcome to the repository!


Here you will find a step by step jupyter notebook that walks you through logistic regression in python.


This repository is essentially a notebook from the following Medium / Towards data science article written by [Maurizio Sluijmers](https://medium.com/@maurizio.s):


[Python (Scikit-Learn): Logistic Regression Classification](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-scikit-learn-logistic-regression-classification-eb9c8de8938d)

## Getting Started

Before you can start using this notebook you need to install [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/). Once conda is installed you can clone the repository to your machine.

To start using this notebook you need to create a virtual environment and install the package dependencies. To do that you can either: 

Use the included environment from this repository by running `conda env create -f env.yml`

-or-

You can [create the virtual environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/create.html) with conda and install the [package dependencies](https://github.com/TedPap/LogisticRegressionTutorial/blob/main/requirements.txt) manually

## Dataset

This example code uses the Titanic dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). This dataset provides us with information about passengers on the Titanic and whether or not they survived. Due to possible copyright issues the dataset is not included in the repository code.
