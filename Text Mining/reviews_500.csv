  My first time buying a OnePlus phone and I really like the finish of the one. Camera is excellent, Android 11 is very smooth to use, functions are fast.Just my first day of usage so hard to be critical of anything. The downside for me is that there is no place expand the memory.---Updating my review after 100 days of using. Bought on April 19th updated review on July 29th.Super fast charging.. 30 mins and goes from say 30% battery to 100% battery charge.I also bought the OnePlus Buds Z along with the phone and these are great quality. Connecting the buds sometimes is an issue. Sometimes it will connect automatically and sometimes it will not detect.Overall I still love this phone though I think its a bit heavy and large screen for non-gamers.

  HiPlease consider this message with a serious note the One Plus 9R which was bought on the above mention date got hanged and did not open exactly on the 13th day of buying it. The replacement policy was only for 10 days and my phone showed prblms from the 13th day. I took it to the One Plus Care Centre and they said it needed an update i waited for 3 days for the 'So Called' update to arrive but after 3 days the Care Centre informed me that this phone needed a Motherboard change when i ask them to replace the phone, they said that the care could not replace it for a new one because i had bought from amazon. They are now suggesting to replace it through amazon only. Is this what i bought a 40k One Plus phone for? If i can only tag the Oneplus company people in this!!!!!What kind of mobile phones do they sell???And also i want to claim a replacement of my phone from Amazon....i just dont care if the 10 days return policy is over.... I just want to say that i bought a 40k worth phone from you guys... And that it doesnt work...been waiting for more than 7 days now....with a ""Dabba"" phone in hand..... Is this the kind of service you provide??? I really would like you to have my phone replaced at the earliest Reply back soon......

  Writing after 4 Days of use1. Heating Issues -you will start noticing from the very first use2. Battery - charges 0 to 100 in just 35-40 mins but also drains so fast. Need to Charges twice in a day after using whatsapp, some browsing, calling.3. Camera - Not very good. Less than as expected. Think twice before buying if you are camera enthusiastic.4. Smooth- 120hZ and 60hZ both condition works well. I found it smooth to use and open apps5. Snap 870 processor really works.6. Other Oneplus features works good.7. Not a flagship phone.Money and Decision is yours..!!Thanks

  I am writing down this after using for a couple of days. I got the carbon black one with 12GB RAM.  Overall the device is good, and honestly is the reskin of one plus 8T with lower price üòÅ.  I will list down the pros and cons -pros -1. With Oxygen OS 11, the overall user experience is quite smooth. You will get an update as soon as you finish setup.2. The Warp 65 fast charging is fine, takes around 35 mins for one full charge.3. The screen to body ratio is good.4. The matt finish on the back side is awesome.Cons -1. Battery drains a little fast, not sure if some future updates will fix it.2. Rear Camera is ok, can be better.3. I would have preferred popup front camera, rather than the punch hole.4. For dual apps, I would have loved to see the option for all apps. Right now it has support for few.5. support for few more 5G bands will be good to have.

  Disappointed. This was my first purchase of oneplus phone and I was so eager to get a hand on it. But seriously there is need for improvement. Battery is like a candle as it is draining easily. Product has no premium finish. Also the display is not up-to the mark. They're claiming it as a gaming phone and sorry to say that you can't use it as a gaming device. Also the camera is average. Please don't go for it as there are lot of other good smartphones in the market with same set of features for 40k. Big no from my side. One plus Nord is better than this and I would recommend One plus should call back entire.  9R series.

  An overall decent phone. The clean software experience would be the reason to choose this instead of Mi 11X or IQOO 7. Hardware wise it's more than capable. The camera I would say , is decent. It depends on your photography skills. The sensor specs only matter so much, I would say invest some time in learning photography. Check the photos attached. If you are a power user , this is one of the best value for money phones at this segment. For the custom rom folks , the kernel is open sourced, so in a year can expect decent ROM. I think IQOO bootloader is not unlocked so keep that in mind.

  As I'm a OnePlus user for more than 4 years now I purchased the OnePlus Plus 9 Pro on 30th March and loved it.And got the 9R for my sister and she loved this phone.I would say it's better to get 9R over 9 else buy the 9 Pro.Camera on the 9R is not as people are saying that it's bad. It's decent for the price. A normal person can't tell the difference btw.Screen is beautiful, phone looks premium.

  ¬†Okay, First of all, I was using oneplus 6 before and was planning for an upgrade, and eagerly waiting for 9 series. I decided to buy Oneplus 9 first, then I came to know that it wont have OIS stabilization. Then I planned to go for Oneplus 9 pro, but !! Insane heating issues and battery draining problem.Why should I waste money for such a phone, and finally I bought Oneplus 9r . Folks Hazzelblad is just a gimmick, Anybody using Oneplus 9R can get the same output using Google camera in OP9R !!Speakers are really good, Dolby Atmos, Cameras are above average+ , Super stable video mode gives you iPhone like stabilization, gaming is supercool, I bought 12/256 varient, and its super snappy, butter smooth. The only struggle I'm facing right now is the availability of accessories like tempered glass and back cases (official glass and cases are really expensive) , and we know this is a new model launched days before, so hopefully it'll sorted soon !!

May be because of fast charge effect, OnePlus should look into this. After 100% charge, it automatically get cooled. no heating issueAs others are complaining there is=> No display tint issues=> No heating issues while using the phone, gaming etc. But noticed while charging=> No charging issues, within 10-15 mins 60-70% chargingRear Camera is good.

  I just switched from OP6.Unlike when I brought the OP6, when I had zero complaints. I'm having many issues with the OP9R from day one.Things to note:1. The display has some major issues, there's an off-axis pinkish tint to whites and grays, which is quite annoying, and almost all the devices seem to affected with this as per OnePlus forums.2. The Camera are just mediocre, and I find the OP9 Camera much better than this. Even though OP9 lacks OIS, it almost always catches better pics and has better focus and stabilization in videos. Like MKBHD said, the Macro and Monochrome sensors are just garbage.3. The whole of the phone, particularly the backplate vibrates on playing sounds, it's pretty annoying and makes the phone feel cheap.Good stuff:1. Warp Charging is unbelievably fast.2. Other than the off-axis color shift, it's a great display.3. The phone is very snappy, added to the 120Hz display gives it a very confident smoothness.Overall:I think OnePlus put very little effort to this phone, as if they made it just to satisfy the Indian customers to complement the OnePlus 9 series. Their quality control seems to be quite bad, as OnePlus forums is full with issues with this device. I have a very unpopular suggestion, buy the OnePlus 9, it's only 7K more (SBI Credit Card). You get a newer and efficient Chipset, a substantially better camera. Having OIS gives no seeming advantage to OnePlus 9.

  Ordered Carbon Black; 12GB+256GB variant.Recieved a day early, on 19 April 2021.First Day Review:This phone is basically an 8T but with a Snapdragon 870, at a lower cost, but that doesnt mean they skimped on quality.So far from 1 day of use, this phone has been incredibly snappy and intuitive. Switching over from a Galaxy Note 8 was a piece of cake, although it took a good few hours to transfer the data.Charging is really quick as you would expect from a 65W WarpCharger.Camera quality is satisfactory in Auto mode, and gets better in Pro Mode with manual control.Speakers are loud and clear, and there is enough stereo seperation that it doesnt feel too unbalanced.Screen gets really bright and colours are accurate, haven't run into any rainbowing, Black Crush or Purple tinting issues. The 120Hz refresh rate also adds to the snappiness feel of the phone.Gaming is really enjoyable, especially those game that take advantage of the features like haptic feedback in COD Mobile. Speaking of which, the haptic motor (vibration) feels super crisp and tight, giving it a premium experience.I had gone for the Carbon Black, and the matte finish on the back glass is exactly what I had hoped for, and the matte finish also has an advantage of repelling fingerprints.So far the phone has been awesome, and I recommend it 10/10.Will update this review if I notice anything off :)

  The only reason I went for Oneplus 9R is that I have been using Oneplus 5T from last 3+ years, the phone is perfectly fine till now and I always wanted to go with Oneplus for the upgrade after using Oneplus 5T and for its great user experience.Coming to the Oneplus 9R, I am not totally satisfied with the phone as I had higher expectations on Oneplus 9R. With the given features and upgrades I feel the phone is not doing so great. When you compare this phones with the similar range of phones from other brands you will have different opinions and thoughts.Pros:- Display quality is very good, with Fluid AMOLED Display and 120 Hz refresh rate display it is buttery smooth- Built quality is great, with aluminum body and Front and back Gorilla Glass 5 protection. Feels premium in hand- Phone speakers are doing well, sound is crisp, loud and with more details- Handset microphone is also great, Can hear the exact voice of the caller and it's clear and loud- Performance - Qualcomm 870 Chipset is doing well, phone is running smooth with no lags so far.- Front camera is good if you compare with other 16MP sensors on other phones.- As usual clean UI experience with Oxygen 11 OS.Cons:- Minor heating issues.  Felt phone was heating up during initial setup, while moving the files from old phone to new one. first 2-3 days felt phone is getting warmer with normal usage aslo and during the time of charging. I feel the heating issues resolved after receiving the first OS update or who knows the phone might be settling down after few days of usage.- Primary camera(s) is not up to the mark, photos can be seen only better in pro mode, videos are little better and front camera is OK. Lots of additional and unnatural colors are being added to the shot. There is no much clarity when you zoom and no details and images are scattered. Camera is not good with the hype which Oneplus created.  I wish Oneplus would be able to fix the camera issues with some good updates if hardware supports and if not then that's it.-Battery backup - Battery drains very quickly with the 120Hz refresh on, battery lasts only for 1 day with full charge and optimal usage. But the good thing is, it charges very quickly as well with 65W Warp charger. from 6 to 100 % took 49 minutes to charge.Overall, if you want to go with the display and performance other then Camera quality and some other issues which I highlighted, then you can go for it and if you are an Oneplus fan.NOTE: Whoever wants good Camera, they might think twice before purchasing this phone. You will get way better camera phones than Oneplus 9R under 40K (38 with discount).

  OnePlus did a blunder with this one. Battery quality is very bad. And it's charging very slow. I'm not sure it's some unit problem or software issue, so I've requested a replacement, but it states over 1 hour to full charge when it's already charged 60%. The charging rate is very low as well, and battery deplete very fast, I can say it depletes faster than it's charging rate.Screen quality is great.Sound quality isn't very good either, it has very less max volume, I literally had to keep it at full volume always for a decent sound.As for heating issues, as everyone else is stating, it's over heating a lot! While normal usage it overheats, let alone any power playing.Honestly, I feel OnePlus made a blunder here. I was really looking forward to this device. Let's see how the replacement unit feels.Edit - battery seem to be performing better after replacement. However, still have issues like overheating and speaker sound.

  The OnePlus 9R is a fair proposition in terms of the phone's pricing. For Rs 39,999, I get great performance, along with a very fluid and clean software experience. The photography, especially in low light, might not be spectacular, but it's still pretty good. Fast charging, decent battery life, and an attractive design contribute to the OnePlus 9R being a great purchase decision.

  I have an OnePlus 3 and an One plus 8 and this this my third purchase of an oneplus phone in the family.A bit disappointed to hold the phone at first after using OnePlus 8 for almost a year now. First, the lack of curved edges deprives you of a smooth navigation gestures especially with the cover on. Further, it is not the slimmest phone in this price catagory. But not so heavy.Full marks to the Super-AMOLED display, which is super cool and crisp. Even in broad sunlight, it is visible because of the 1,100 nits it offers. Build quality is very premium. Ergonomically well designed. Perfect for one-handed opraration. The front and rear is of corning gorilla glass 5 and the frame is metal (where as for the OnePlus 9 the frame and rear are of plastic!!) Lucky me! So it looks very elegant. But no IP rating for water proof is disappointing. But company says it is water proof. The insulation in the SIM tray is an evidence.The phone is superfast with a great sensitivity for touch and swipe gestures with the Snap Dragon 870 processor. 120 hz refresh rate is super smooth. Gamers would love it with a top-notch haptics (vibration features) and with the 244 hz touch sampling rate.Battery charging is very fast too. The juice holds up for quite long because of the better power management by the latest processor and the LLDR 5 RAM. Delightful!! Occassional warming yes during heavy games. That's normal. Camera is decent. Front camera is 16 MP should be a 32 in this price range. Avoid beautification option as you may look like a cartoon. Rear camera takes above average photos in day light. But below average during low light/ nights especially the wide angle camera. But it has optical image stabilisation even the OnePlus 9 doesn't have that. So shaky hand fellows don't worry for the blur. Videos are of best quality. Best in this category. With a good video editor and skill you can make cinema like videos but the stabilisation is not-so-good in the nights.Stereo speakers are of very good quality. It is loud and doesn't crack even at high volumes. Call quality is decent. Not comparable with iPhones though. And Dolby audio is very enjoyable with headphones. With a good quality earphones/ headsets, I assure it is not less than a immersive audio experience especially for games.'Flip to mute' and 'raise the phone to answer' features are missing. Don't know why. It is just a OnePlus 8T with a good looking rear camera console with Rs.3000 less. Even the cover of 8T suits perfectly on this.So overall I am satisfied if not delighted. My OnePlus 8 is still better I feel. But this is the best in this price range. Better than the vivo x60, Mi11X pro or even the samsung S20 FE especially for the build quality and the premium feel it gives. Also the oxygen OS is best out of all android OS'. Also the in-display finger print sensor and the face unlock, I have not experienced  anything faster, prompter and more acuurate in recent times with anyother gadgets!! But the phone has only one 5G band. Suggest not to use the cover supplied with the box. It gives a kinda smoky look and makes the phone look bulky. But withstands accident falls. I have ordered the sandstone bumper case from the OnePlus store. Lake blue colour variant is awesome. Best of all the colors of all the OnePlus phones till today in my opinion. Catches not much finger prints or smudges like the 8 series. Scratch proof. Phone comes with a pre-applied scratch gaurd sticker. So no extra purchase required. Charging cable is a bit shorter than OnePlus 8. Type C charger with 65W charging adapter. 0 to 100 in 50 minutes. One significant change here is the data transfer to and from computer is quite faster than my OnePlus 8 also using OTG. Adaptive brightness they have got it right this time. In previous Oneplus devices, it was irritating. I have become loyal to OnePlus because the life of OnePlus phones is quite long compared to any other leading brands. My OnePlus 3 still stands formidable after 5 years. One star less just for the absense of curved edges display and a not-so-slim thickness. Else this phone is very good. Though corner of my mind says the price should be 10% lesser.P. S.Not encountered any overheating or battery draining issues as highlighted by some users. May be because I bought the phone after the release of first software update  and updated before writing this review. If you are not a fan of flagship processors and not a gamer, go for the OPPO F19 Pro with half of this price. Slimmer, lighter and with 3.5 mm jack.

  Review after 7 days of extensive usage.¬†‚Ä¢¬†I would say the performance you are going to get one oneplus and that OxygenOS touch you gonna get from knowhere. It's too smooth to handle after using this you'll find thise ""IOS"" devices are lagging cuz they aren't having 120 Hz display even the price for iphone 12 is almost double the price of oneplus 9R.Pros:¬†‚Ä¢¬†Snapdragon 870 which is smooth as hell either it be for video editing and redndering or it be for playing games. Even the ""Call of Duty"" runs like water buttery smooth at max fps.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Tested this device while playing games on it like COD/Free Fire with max Resolution and FOS and would say thermals are very good it won't heat up after almost an hor of gaming temp was still maintained to be as 40¬∞C in a Non AC room.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Video Stability and recording best in the market if you turn night mode on even in the dark scenes it is well lit up no one can guess it was shooted in night. Video potrait is best for content creater the bokeh effect is mouth watering for the content creators the bokeh youll get is as similar as you'll get in a dslr camera but the surrounding should be well lit up.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Oxygen OS it is the best operating system I've seen on an Android device unlike other OS available for Android.¬†‚Ä¢¬†User interface is best thing of oneplus devices you can't get rid of it's addiction even you'll start hating IOS üòÖ not actually but it's the best UI I've ever used¬†‚Ä¢¬†You'll get 5g support so you don't need to worry about future upgrades. This will work smooth.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Design and placement of Camera Module is the best the oneplus have done ever while it's completely subjective, but youll get ü¶ç Glass 5 protection on front and back along with a aluminum chasis/side frame it's a well built device simply rigid and feels premium to hold.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Haptic is best in the price range.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Dua Dolby Stereo Speakers make it loud enough to consume your content at any place¬†‚Ä¢¬†Full day power just in few minutes this device comes with a 65W wrap charge which will charge your device in just the time span of 30/35 mins. You'll never fall short of power either it be powerful performance or the power interms of battery.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Oneplus's Fluid Amoled display is best screen I've ever seen smooth responsive and vivid best for Netflix, lovers xD.Cons:¬†‚Ä¢¬†There are some bugs oneplus need to solve it as it isn't justified for this kind of flagship devices. I'm mentioning few of them oneplus pls act accordingly.¬†‚Ä¢¬†While using YouTube  the framerate drops I don't know it's a google fault or what but even the notification bar seem to be freezing while scrolling down as to like 90fps. There are few more applications like Google photos application which I've discovered uptil now.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Phone get warms outside it might be due to the electronic devices catch too much of heat radiations from Sun rays.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Oneplus pls provide One-Hand mode as soon as possible as the device is having a large form factor it's quite not possible for using the device single handedly even if I am having really large palms and long fingers indeed, I am just thinking anout those girls having small cute palms and fingersüíÖü§£üòÖ.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Now jumping to camera section one plus needs to work on the picture capturing algorithm the problems faced were like...¬†‚Ä¢¬†1) Sometime captures undersaturated photos in potrait and 2x Zoom mode.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Need to work on the algorithm of focusing as it hunts for focus sometimes in the darker.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Basically Camera needed to be well optimized by oneplus in few aspects rather say camera performance is awesome just few bugs are needed to be solved. I've attached few pictures you can refer to those.Conclusion:¬†‚Ä¢¬†If you want a well built phone with best processing speeds and Video Capabilities you can opt for it it's is the best device in my terms under 50k budget but few bugs and improvisation are required & I hope Oneplus will donit sooner or later.Thanks for reading my review.

  None of the features are good and looks really cheap. If you're OnePlus user do not buy this any of the 9 series it's only a trash.Picture quality is very low if you click snap you'll feel like you took a picture from a cheap 3k mobile. Worst phone ever regret the decision to buy this shot.

  I have been using Realme 2 pro for the past 2 and half years and I felt like I needed a upgrade and bought OnePlus 9R, have to say it's a worthy upgrade and the speed is amazing. Everything is super fast and 120hz refresh rate is cherry on the top. Camera is okaish nothing that great. There are some heating here and there while using apps. Battery is okay as well. If you are using heavily it will not last you for a day, with normal usage it will easily last for a day. Also the phone fully charges in 40 minutes thanks to the 65w fast charging. OxygenOs is good nothing that great. There are lots of booklets inside the box, I hope next time OnePlus reduce that and instead add a usb c to 3.5mm jack adaptor. This is the first time I am using a OnePlus phone and I am really enjoying every moment of it and I would recommend this phone to everyone who is planning on upgrading their phone.

  This is the best smartphone you can purchase under 40k...I researched alot and found out it is way better than iqoo 7 legend and S20fer..In Iqoo you can face after sale service and in S20fe you are getting plastic back, slow charging, low brightness and laggy uiThis is my first time using OnePlus device shifting from Oppo K1, the best thing about this phone is the build quality and oxygen os.... beleive me if you once use oxygen os you can't shift to other UI easily, Oxygen OS can be the single reason to purchase itPros :- Performance beast, no lag at all anywhere- BGMI working great in 60fps, soon it'll get 90fps too- Build quality , it's feels premium in hand- Display, the colors, brightness are awesome and cherry on the cake is the bezels it's almost negligible compared to other devices in this range- Haptic Feedback is of flagship level- Battery backup is decent for 1 day use and 65 watt charger is also a plus point, it charges 0-100% in 40 min- Stereo Speakers is best in this range- Indisplay Fingerprint is lightning fast and especially it's placement is even better than that on 9 proCons :- Bit heavy, maybe because I shifted from 156 gm device to 190gm, but you'll get use to it- Camera is the only weak point, front camera is just average, yes the back camera 48 mp does it's job especially in video recording, it gives the most stable videos compared to any other device in this range... only the picture quality is not that great compared to S20feConclusion : If you are very camera centric user and want IP68 rating, avoid 9r and go with s20fe, else in everything OnePlus just kills S20fe easily and don't go with iqoo 7 legend just for 888 , 870 is almost as par as 888... Thanks for reading do give it a like and have a nice day

  You may get phones with better on paper specs at this price, but none have this quality. The build quality is significantly better than the competition. The frame is aluminium with a glass black and premium looking matte finish. Oxygen OS feels simple, practically useful and premium unlike those overwhelmingly bloated skins in Xiaomi, Vivo and Samsung phones. The phone has a great display, much better than the competition. The vibration motors are Iphone quality, not the usual cheap quality vibration motors found in the competitiors. The battery life is much better than advertised. I am able to get 6 hours of playtime on heavy games like COD Mobile on full charge. 65W fast charging is stupendously fast. No heating issues whatsoever even while gaming. Buttery smooth performance in daily usage as well as games. Idle battery time is amazing. The cameras are great but lack in colour calibration. Other competitors offer better cameras. Overall, Oneplus is the only brand offering clean software experience in this range, which is the most important thing in a phone.

  Extremely slow and disappointing product. I have been using OnePlus since they launched OnePlus One. And this is by far the worst product I have ever seen for the following reasons1. Display screen blinking again and again2. Burning hot after just two hours of use3. Battery life is pathetic, only lasts 6-7 hours before needing charge again4. Unable to perform multiple functionsI would never recommend this product to anyone. I'm officially not a OnePlus customer after this.

  I felt like this oneplus 9R is Best in oneplus 9 series. It's worth of 40k. The 65w warp charger is just amazing that your phone gets charged from15% to 100% in just 38mins. I did not not felt much heating issue. Frequently close the recent apps and clear the cache. If you strain the phone too much it will obviously heats. Camera is fine but not a wow factor. Display is just amazing. Phone runs pretty fast with Snapdragon 870. If you are confused with 9, 9pro and 9R, would definitely recommend 9R because it's worth the penny. 9 and 9pro doesn't make any sence with the hasselblad. Not much different with the cameras. It's seems just a hype. Go for 9R you would save 10k comparing with the other 9 series.

  It has been more than 3 months since i am using OP 9r. I have ordered it in first sale.So i must say everything is fabulous in this phone whether it is looks, performance, display Or Camera. Don't get confused when i say camera is great because many of the big youtubers have criticised its camera when compared it with Samasung galaxy s20 5G.So after seeing comparison i thought to switch to samsung galaxy s20 5G. So i decided to go to samsung store just to check if it is that good. And trust me guys, S20 looks way cheaper and like a normal phone. The time i took it in my hand i decided to stay with OP 9R. Even i have compared the camera as well and have not noticed any difference. So for normal users, if you are not a tech enthusiast, you won't be able to find any difference between two when it comes to camera. And please don't trust these youtubers. They are just making money by making us fool. Before making any decision just visit to the samsung or oneplus store.And as of now, i have not noticed any con in this phone. Everything is smooth specially the display. Also there is no heating issue but gets little warm during the charging. Battery life is also decent. If you are a normal user it will last one and half day. Also, it takes 40 to 45mins to charge it fully. So if you have the budget, then go for it. You will not regret it.

  Switched from One plus 5T.Slight overheating issue but that was the case with 5T as well. I am not a high end gamer but a general user, reading work emails, scrolling social media and playing card games.- The UI is amazing, very smooth as compared to 5T.- Camera is good at this range but not to be compared with phones which have camera as the sole USP.- Battery Backup is quite good with me staying on the phone all the time, it dropped from 100-30% in a day of full usage (and some board and card games)The options I compared before buying it:1. Samsung FE S20: Probably the only switch I could have done, but my experience with 5T helped me stay loyal to One plus.2. IQOO 7: Performance and feature wise, slightly better, lower price too. One plus suits social status and IQOO is a newer brand still building it's reportaire.3 iPhone 11: Old vs new dilemma, iPhone 12 was double the price. Switching after 3 years, I wanted a phone fresh in the market.4 MI XI: MI is for masses and I wouldn't buy a premium phone from this brand.

  I ordered product with great hope, but all were dashed when during the call, words went missing on both sides. As a Caller, i was hearing things partially and the same was happening with the call receiver. We both were hearing things not completely as if we were talking like fill in the blanks. I don't know what to call this technically. But this issue happened even after replacement and I had to finally return the product. Now, I use airtel postpaid and this problem never happened even with my old moto G5S plus & doesn't happen till now. Unfortunately, it kept on happening with one plus 9R.

  Phone turns hot even without playing games,  watching content, or even using camera! Oxygen OS feels a tone-downed version of those available in lower OnePlus devices, with no Oxygen Messenger, Dialer, etc. Also, OnePlus treats you with ads (reminders) for Red Cable membership every time you open settings.Honestly it has no special features or terrific performance that would make it distinct from phones available under 30K.

  Buy this phone only if you want a OnePlus phone(fanboy/fangirl) or are a fan of Oxygen OS.Other than that,the device is overpriced and the camera quality is very basic and takes the beat from phones available at a lower price.Main issue is only two 5G bands. Also this can't be fixed with OTA updates due to limited hardware(affirmed by OnePlus in an official statement).Processor is the same 865 rebranded with very slight clockspeed increase on a single core.Battery is good,really good.65W charge is one of the best in it's league. A top competitor in battery.Good build quality.Decent speakers(Dolby stereo).Decent haptics.If the cons don't bother you and you just need a premium phone for basic use,then go for it(though this argument doesn't make sense since it's waste of money and you can buy a good mid range phone instead).Additional info-Want a gaming phone in the budget in neighborhood of 9R? Buy iQOO 7 Legend instead. A really balanced phone except the FunTouch OS which I ain't fan of. Also don't go for OnePlus 9 as it's useless device(especially the Indian variant). Have money enough to buy a premium flagship,then buy OnePlus 9 Pro 5G.Want a phone with multiple features,flagship performance and balanced,go for Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G(only con is old SoC 865).That's it. Have a good day. Out.

  Most awaited phone given such a worst experience..Pros - Nice build quality & very handy phone. Super Processor performance.Super speed Charging..Cons - Worst camera quality for such price range product i must say.. Camera quality cant meet that expectation for a Oneplus lover. Speaker Sound quality - Horrible vibration for the phone once the volume hits the maximum bar..!!! Never expect this from Oneplus..!@ Amazon -Shows 7 days replacement : Complaint raised & Technician support offered , but that was beyond the replacement day policy. So they havent done anything.Called Oneplus. They Offered service at home through Oneplus Care app. But while login , no service available.Again called the service people & they said to visit nearby authorized service dealer & ensured store is open. But when i reach there , it was also closed.Dear Oneplus - Pls take that zero rating from a oneplus brand loved person.....!

  Edit (28-Jul-2021)... The phone has Google dialer (not OnePlus Dialer). So those who record calls regularly be forewarned that Google Dialer makes an announcement at the beginning and end of recording that is heard by both persons (the dialer person and the person who made the call). The only workaround is to sideload the OnePlus dialer but then it has to be manually updated if and when there's a new update.I was in 2 minds after reading a lot of negative reviews here as well as on YouTube (particularly about the camera), but I am completely satisfied with the phone overall (including the camera).1. Great fast changing (from 0 to full well under 45 minutes)2. Good looks3. Comfortable to hold and operate4. Does not heat up significantly either on charging or on playing games (COD)5. Excellent gameplay6. Beautiful display (even in daylight)7. Speaker is loud and clear8. Awesome gaming mode9. Oxygen OS üíú10. Battery lasts one and a half days with moderate use.

  If you have a budget of 40000 this is one of the better phone to go for.1.Oxygen OS2.Good built quality3.Good performance4.Good screen5.Very fast charging6.Oneplus brandingThese being a few of the reasons. Even I was confuced after reading a few reviews about the camera and heating issues, but I would say camera is decent and I did not come across any heating issue as such, yes it does get hot after some gaming but the performance remains good. So I would suggest you to go for it.

  Though the other reviews say a wonderful phone, I didn't see it so in the 2 weeks I've been using this.The worst part is OnePlus has limited 5G bands support. Only 2 bands, they thought it could be fixed with Software update but it's hardware issue. They can't fix that in this 9 series. I thought of returning it to get S20 FE but missed the return date by a day. I'll not keep this phone for much longer.Not a great battery backup. Less than 10hr on normal usage of calls and apps without wifi or any gaming. The OS actually takes up a lot of battery. The only positive point is 65W warp charger, charges phone in less than 45 mins.Camera is ok but not upto the mark for a 40K phone. 9R doesn't have the fancy camera setup. The selfies are better than the rear camera and even they are not good.Fingerprint reader lags sometimes. Doesn't read the finger unless I press it hard on the screen.It feels like a 6GB ram phone, not an 8GB one. Didn't see much difference from old iPhone 6S. Could do better in almost all aspects.

  I don't understand the hype at all. It is fast ..fluid .. but the camera is just so horrendous.  Colours are over saturated. And I've tried to adjust display/ advanced display options thinking it may help with colour reproduction in the photos but nothing helps at all. Depth of field is fine but photos are more than just about depth. Especially under artificial lighting Skin tones appear washed out or reddish and my green mask looks grey.. maybe it can be improved with software updates. But as of now in the camera dept. It sucks so bad. Aside from the camera, the phone works well. Fingerprint reader in quick. And I get good battery life after adjusting a few things in settings  I've not experienced any heating even while charging or even while playing a few games or two during charge.

  Writing this review after using the device for 10 days. This is my first One Plus device and it has met the expectations. I have always been an android favoring person over iOS because the customizing that comes to the table and make the usage of the mobile for lively.Software - 4/5 - Clean OS experience but saw few issues while screen refreshing when the mob is on charging mode. This is very minimal and all of the other options are good.Battery - 4/5 - I am not a gamer and a single charge is lasting me for 1 days with calls, Internet browsing. The Wrap charger is awesome with ful charge in 45-50 minutes. Device heats up during charging at times and this is also small issue.Camera - 4/5 - Not a Camera enthusiastic and the Camera works pretty good for a normal users.Call quality and call connections are pretty good.Audio is pretty good and Video is a treat to the eyes with nice display.Cons - Nothing could I find until now but as everyone says 3.5 MM jack should have been there.

  Posting after 2 weeks of usage:I had been perpetually using OnePlus phones since last ~7 years. I have used various models starting from OnePlus 2, till my last phone OnePlus 6. The OnePlus phones never forced me to change, as they never showed up any issues even after 3+ years of continuous usage. I changed the phone just as I got bored with my OnePlus 6 and wanted to upgrade to the latest OS. One Plus I used for the longest time is over 3 years - and it had been working seamlessly.This version has disappointed me a bit. The biggest issue is the phone gets heated up. This had never happened in their previously released models. I mean, nowadays heating happens probably in very cheap phones.Other dislikes1. Finger print and face recognition do not give you a premium experience2. Camera quality is just adequate. I have seen better cameras at half the price in brands like SamsungLikes:1. OnePlus never hangs, so till now no such trouble2. Gesture controls are good. One may take couple of days to get accustomed, but then it becomes handy3. Screen size is good. Every bit is used, no notch on the top (just a round front camera). Removing buttons from the screen bottom (you can rather use gesture controls) gives you the entire screen size for viewing and using the phone.4. Speaker quality is better than the past models5. Battery life is better than previous models at lease till now

  Previously I was using a Oneplus 5 which is gem of a phone. Kind of way ahead of its time and very reasonably priced. Compared to that, this phone is only a slight improvement in performance but price difference did not justify the purchase.Pros :1. Speed2. Screen3. Zero bloatware4. Fast charging.5. Decent camera. Not excellent but not bad either.Cons.1. Way way way overpriced for what is inside the box.2. NO water protection rating.3. Only one band of 5g supported. So it is useless of for 5g communication in most of the cases.4. Not at all satisfied with battery life for this price.5. This issue is not an issue for everyone. I a facing problems with native call recording which was working fine in oneplus 5. They should provide their own dialer instead of using android stock version.

  I was using OP7 before, from that experience I feel 9R is one of the worst phone ever.1.Performance- No doubt SD 870 was fast actually it‚Äôs SD 865++. RAM Management is also good. Manages heavy apps and multitasking easily.2.Battery- it has good amount battery but it drains very fast. Have to charge multiple times in a day.3. 5G Bands- Freaking 1 band and they tell it‚Äôs 5G powered. Well Settled OP4. Camera- No words totally waste lens.5. Display- Superb Display Quality with smooth transition. 120HZ but drains battery quickly.6. Speakers- No words to express Dolby Atmos is fantastic super loud. Some times can feel vibration at back of the phone.7. OS- Very clean OS with similar Stock OS experience. But has some bugs in it.Conclusion- The OP 9R is only worth for 27k not more than that. It‚Äôs just a rebadged 8T to be very frank.Also note you can consider ‚ÄúGoogle Pixel 4a‚Äù which is really a good phone compared to this OP. Yeah it has low specs but it‚Äôs really good.Peace!!!!!

  I don't know what people (who gave less than 3 rating) are complaining so much about. I never faced such issues. It's a total value for money phone. This phone comes from a good brand and gives premium experience. People who are complaining might be having so many expectations or they might have found their old phones better than this. But I'm buying OnePlus for the first time. The phone totally makes sense. People whoever is complaining just suggest a better phone than this at this price range in a good brand. My opinion is this phone doesn't have a great camera. It has a decent one and all other things about this phone are classy. People who want a phone which is VFM at this point of time, just go for this.

  Dislike. Though the performance is a bit good. The battery performance is poor.  Changed 60% in the morning and by 2pm, it reached lower 14%. Heating makes little nervous. while speaking or during watching any movie, the total body is vibrating, this makes us uncomfort. I change over from Samsung to One plus after Amazon review, but no such a comfort like Samsung. Sometimes ear paining when speak continuously over 10 mins.(SAR??). Amazon sells at MRP (44K) by artificially making high review points and the EMI scheme little bit lingering like EMI discount is sucked back through bank interest.

  Posting this Review after using 9R for one month.Pros1. Build quality is awesome.2. If you are in much gaming this phone will satisfy you with performance and battery optimization.3. If you use it heavily like gaming and social networking site it will give you a single day backup easily.4. As Oxygen is the refined version in all Android O.S, so you definately will get the performance boost.5. Double speakers and dolby atmos is awesome.6. 65 watt wrap charger and it can full charge the phone by approx 20-30 mins.Cons1. Camera can be much optimized. Quality can be improved.2. Only a single band is available of 5g network. Hope we will fall into that band.Rest i am using One Plus mobile for first time and i can definately say i choose a good phone.Just an advice, if you are looking for performance go for it.Rating 4/5.

  I have purchased OnePlus 9R on 15/07/2021 and the device got delivered on 16/07/2021. Delivery was on time and packaging was good.Now, let's discuss about the device (positive points):1. Oneplus 9R device has the potential to perform better, only some tweaks in the software is required to improve its performance to the best.2. Overall the build quality of the device is very good, I have bought the carbon black 8gb / 128 gb variant and it seems to perform well. The device has got Snapdragon 870 chipset which performs well.3. I have played Call of duty mobile at full high graphics settings and the device worked flawlessly, without any lags or crash.4. Battery backup is also good, you get 1.5 days of backup when moderately used and approx 1 day of backup when heavy used.5. No lags or issues found till now in UI.6. It got quite warm during the setup but as soon as I reduced the brightness of the device, it felt not much warm but it is obvious for the device to get warm because lots of processing is going on in the background and also the device is set to 120 hz refresh rate.Don't go for negative comments, some people are dumb (except few who are genuinely facing issue with the device) as they don't know how to use smartphones.

  The phone is amazingly blazing fast and smooth.Yes, it heats up when you are going to use this for the FIRST time and that is because there are a lot of background applications running like backup of Google, phone setup, etc but that goes away when backup is done.I really loved this phone truly OnePlus experience of performance and speed. That 120hZ refresh makes the device very smooth.Only downsides I have noticed are:Camera's (they are good but not good in this price range especially the selfie one)Battery drains a lot quicker. It is like if you want something you have to compromise on another, in this case for higher refresh rate you compromise with battery. This will need a refill in the evening when charged in morning, maybe this can be fixed through an update.

  I'm regular user of OnePlus Mobiles from OnePlus 5T to OnePlus 7. Unfortunatlly due to past experience I again puchased OnePlus 9R, afetr uses after one weak first time i'm very disappinted  due very poor performence of 9 series devices.Cons:1. Heating issue2. Network reception problem.3. Bluetooth connectivity problem during calls, calles intruppted very much, I used 3 bluetooth devices for comformation.4. Flikring in display sometime found like oneplus 8 series.5. Fingerprint reader lag issue sometime.6. Built quality not like previous oneplus series. feels like 15k to 20k device quality. Realme 7X Pro better than Oneplus 9R.7. At last I felt very much cheated after no more 5G Band announcement for Indian versions of 9 series, not expected from oneplus for Indian Buyers only, they treated Indian buyers like poor people.At last I advise please don't buy like me, otherwise you feel Bad. I tried to return but there is only replacement policy for this product, no refund. Now I Shifted to my old favorate SAMSUNG Galaxy Series.Pros:Only Show-off that i'm a Oneplus user. Now it is not a prememum mobile.

  I have been a OnePlus 5T user from more than 3years. I liked it very much and OnePlus used to be the best value for money phones. that's reason I have ordered OnePlus agian though the price is high for the phone with competetors. But really disappointed with OnePlus 9R now, the phone is getting heat, hang and screen not working I have tried basic trouble shooting but isn't helpful. I think this is the worst phone from OnePlus. Lost trust in OnePlus Phones and not realiable as earlier and have become expensive too.

  Gifted this phone to my father. Based on the paper stats, phones seems nearly perfect, but when using it in practical life, experience is something different.Camera is below par (at this budget, oneplus could have given more IMO)Heating Issues - Even while casual browsing (No Hardcore games), phone tends to heat a lot. Sometimes the screen gets struck and hard restart is required as the screen is stuck (happens once in a month)Call Quality is also below par ( have used previous one Plus phones, quality was lot better)The only positive thing about the phone is the Oxygen OS.

  Box contents are the phone, charging cable, good tpu case, and some paperworks.So I am a 1+7 Pro User and then this is my second OP phone because I like Oxygen OS and no bloatware unlike any other brands.I have used Xaomi, Motorola, Nokia, Samsung, Sony, Huawei and Redmi phones and I can say 1+ has the cleanest and simplest UI.It's fast and responsive and 1+ does provide updates which usually improves the phone gradually.The Build Quality is Fantastic. Feels Sturdy in Hand and very premium. I can say this glass finish on back is even better than my OP7 Pro. Loved it. Although It lacks the Symmetrical look from the OP7 Pro it still looks good.Battery drains fast but it's ok. Because u have 65w fast charger out of the box and believe me it's fast.  My mom loves the fast charging feature because she is always in a hurry and this saves her time. Last moment charging and juice to run a day is superb. 100% better than my OP7 Pro.Now coming to Display, it's a really good Screen. I must say I got jealous of the brightness. Felt better than my OP7 Pro at times. However saturation or is not less as compared to the latter, let's say probably 1+ decided to go with more of natural colours even  after display calibration. It's just a matter of preferance but I am sure no one will be disappointed by the screen.Sound is Amazing on all aspects be it speakers or headphones or even the earpiece. Crisp and clear. Speakers are fairly loud as well.Gaming is Epic The 120 Hertz screen does do its job well. All games can be played on high resolution and 90-120 Hertz.I tried COD and Asphalt. I can say it's better than my OP7 Pro.Now finally coming to the Camera. The picture of the Rose was taken from its main camera. Rest pics of the phone taken from my 1+7 Pro. I would let u be the judge of them.Finally I can say I am happy with the purchase.Just one Advise to all. Do Not Buy On EMI.Because bank charges more interests than discount given by Amazon listing which is very misleading.

  This is the best performing phone in the market right now, 120hz really makes a difference and i can see the difference between 90hz and 120hz so yeah you need it for future proof. Camera, well camera works fine, not the best in class, gcam port gives you night mode in the front camera which you don't get in the stock app. If camera is not your main priority go for this or 8T, which ever you find at best deal, there's hardly any difference. In 8T you get covers and accessories comparatively easily. I got 9R with exchange and other offers at a very attractive price. Also i could have gone for iqoo 7 legend but stock android was my top priority which got me into taking 9R, if that is os skin doesn't bother you i would suggest you to go for IQOO 7, that is a better option with better camera and better price. Hope this helps, Happy Shopping

  Pros:Premium Aluminium frame and glass back120Hz screenFlaghship level performanceGreat for gamingGreat cameras for the segmentWarp charge 65Cons:Minor heating issuesI have been using this phone for more than two weeks now. Very happy with the purchase, however, Amazon did take a bit longer to deliver this considering other Prime deliveries. My gaming is casual, but I did not notice major battery drain or heating during my usual 90 mins or so of daily PubG at UltraHD and ultra frame rate. The cameras are great, but color representation could have been more acurate compared to flagships. Low light images are great as well. The selfie camera isnt 'amazing' but is sharp and reprodues colors well. OIS works great. The phone feels really premium, and everyday usage is a breeze with apps opening and instaling snappily. The touch sampling is amazing. Battery backup is considerably good considering that I have had the screen at 120Hz since the day I got the phone. Warp charge 65 is a great aid. I have noticed minor heating, but the aluminium frame at the top edge gets considerably hotter than the back with intense gaming. Highly recommended purchase. I havent used the OnePlus 9, but most tech reviews I consulted were speculative about if it is worth investing 10K more on the 9 instead. Lake blue is really beautiful!

  ¬†First time buying one plus,my overall experience is good with the ph after using 4 days.Display: 5/5Performance:5/5 (with oxygen os)Camera: 3.5/5Gaming:4.5/5Sound:5/5(Dolby op)First coming about display 120hz amoled display is great. Next the oxygen os which i liked most. Stock ui is rare now a days and oxygen os is kind of customisable stock ui. I don't think except ios no ui is better than oxygen os. No bloatware,no ads which gives very good user experience. Performance is also awesome, i hear a lot about heating issues but it's fixed almost 50%. after the update and ph heat is general problem. Even iph also heat. U can play pubg hdr+extreme. I prefer smooth+extreme for best fps nd less heat. The one thing i don't like is camera. I mean camera is very decent,even iq 7 camera is very good than this which also costs 10k less. One plus should look out this matter. At last i say if ur main priority is camera then go with other brand otherwise it worths every penny.

  Awesome like ever before. Upgraded from my OnePlus 7. I don't worry about cameras.. bcoz I don't have to buy OnePlus for cameras.. it's not a camera phone.. it's meant to be speedy.. nice looks. Premium feel.. smooth and fast.. the only thing I don't like is the new navigation gestures. I like gestures from down side only but.. for going back the only option is swiping from the sides of the screen.. I don't like that and I don't have the option to change it also. Display is awesome. Battery is also impressive. Charging is super speedy.  And the other thing I didn't like is the drop down menu . When we swipe down from the middle or any other part of the screen .. earlier it brings the drop down menu..but now the this action brings the OnePlus quick menu. And the drop down menu appears only when swiped down from above. I hope it will be sorted out. Keeping these aside.. it's just OnePlus legend...

  Overall I am writing this phone review after using it for about 3weeks!! I must tell this is a terrific device with 120Hz refresh rate. It is pretty fast and has got powerfull processor. The main advantage of OnePlus nowdays is the ""OXYGEN OS"". THE PERFECT, CLEAN AND NO AD OS out of the box. Nothing is perfect and yes even this device it's not perfect but ideal device! It's the best device for day-to-day usage. People have been complaining about the camera in the previous reviews but I believe there was nothing so bad as stated in the review. This phone has got a decent camera but it works pretty fine and it's perfect at it's view. I haven't seen any heating issue so far. Yes while using camera the device gets little warm at the back but it looks down immediately after the application is closed. And the WARP charger is a master piece. I don't have to wait for my phone to get 100% charged for a long it as it charged up in 30mins. It fast, flawless and convenient smartphone. Coming to the 5G thing, as OnePlus claims this device is 5G ready, but giving just 5G and claiming the phone is 5G is a complete disappointmrnt according to my point of view. Keeping these aside the device is an all-rounder overall you can go with the device no problem! I am satisfied! üåà

  Been using this phone for around 4 days now and I find it really good. I saw comments on this being overheated, but I didn't face any such issue. Ofcourse, when you're setting up your phone a lot of things happen in the background. Your apps are being downloaded, the phone updates are downloaded and in this case the phone will get a little bit warm. Which is completely normal in my opinion. Also heard a lot of negative reveiws about camera. Now I am not a person who'll look at intricate details in images and compare it to the iPhones and Samasung Galaxy S series. Obviously, it's not the best, but does the job. If camera is your main factor of buying a phone then you can look elsewhere.

  During Unboxing-To be honest the first impression about the 9R was totally on the Opposite side except for the design side.During the initial setup, I never experienced such a thriller as the phone was getting warmer by every minute. Thanks to the Oxygen OS update 11.2.3.3 which made a huge difference on the same day of unboxing.Seriously, The phone reached a peak temperature when the new update was getting downloaded and installed and during charging as well (Seriously, At some point, I had to leave the phone for a safer distance... funny but TRUE).Thanks to the 1+ teams effort to solve the ""UnUsual"" heating issue.Now after Two weeks of usage and even after many heavy usages the phone never got warmer so i think this will continue (fingers crossed).Pros :1. Display - 120Hz - Now I am damn sure that I can never go back to the lower refresh rates screen phones. The phone's display is silky/Buttery smooth (Take whichever you like). The adaptive / Dynamic refresh rate option is a good one that actually saves battery by optimising it based on the usage.2. Camera- Never had a complaint so far. Got a lot of options especially in PRO mode. The end result of a photo (Quad of Selfi) can directly relate to the amount of light that the camera sensor gets when you press the shutter.3. Performance - 870 chipset is really good. No problem so far and it is highly efficient in managing the RAM especially when playing Games.4. Oxygen OS - Got released (First 1+ phone for me) when started using this phone OS as it is free from Ads and other Bloatware especially the installed/suggested Apps.5. Charging- Charging experience is named perfectly as ""WARP CHARGING"" really good option to have and it fills the battery from 0 to 100 well under 45 mins. No heat observed during charging.6. Battery - So far so good 1.5 to 2 days of battery life between charging with moderate usage( 5 to 6 hours of screen usage). For me, this device didn't die within 1 day. I don't mind if the phone runs out of charge by end of the day as it has Warp Charging a must for all the devices.7. Haptic motor-Very good touch and feel when the motor vibrates feels premium.Con:1. Pricing - Price could have been much more competitive at the end of the day not only the corporate should feel good about profit but majorly the end customers should feel good about the purchase.Finally, as a one-liner I can say, An all-rounder device packed with all the Essentials/Expected points for this present trend but if you can afford it.

  Not at all satisfied with the product.I feel it's not worth money i.e.40k. The battery discharges very fast nd I can't even use it for half a day.. That too without using any high battery utility apps. As I was not available at destination, got only two days to realise this problem. I was shocked to know that return policy was only for 7 days against normal period of 30days. Do I have any solution to return or replace or rectify the issue... kindly let me know...

  Bought this phone through amazon received on 15th August ther was a manufacturing defect the charger was not getting connected to the port. Called up customer support but the agent were very rude and not helpful. final had a tech visit the house and said that the phone has a manufacturing defect and was already used prior to me receiving the product and is not sure how the product was shipped to me, still awaiting for a phone to be sent to me. Well if amazon is so serious about there customer first thing it needs to do is train the agents on how to speak to a customer.I have been a prime member for years now but will consider as to whether i should renew it next time.Thank you Amazon

  The phone is as you would expect from OnePlus.Fast, smooth, clean, in short, amazing.The heating issue that the phone had at launch is now almost gone through OTA update.It is though a bummer that the phone has just one 5G band and OnePlus has now confirmed that they won't increase 5G bands on the phone through OTA updates due to hardware limitations. So users wanting to have a phone with good amount of 5G bands, I suggest you look elsewhere.All in all, a great experience from OnePlus.Cons: Average camera, one 5G band.

  Reason why i have chosen this to be not so flagship will sum up this point as i proceed,9r is overpriced device. No doubt it comes with 870g Snapdragon processor but it lacks other points as well, no doubt in hand feel makes it to another level. but as soon as we launch camera app it ruined the expectation of flagship, display is good not great but colors are punchy and vivid while playing 4k Videos. Heated initially completing the process but we get update out of the box, after update also camera quality is not that good. Its OIS and focus is not good, I know that I shifted from samsung S8 that is remarkable except burning issue and their pathetic service. Hence I decided to switch but S8 is just way more premium till now. Look wise 9r is truly flagship device, but below average camera shown that device is not worth at all.****************65 Watt charger : Its bulky and not portable, don't know why they bundled brick like adapters. comparing it with samsung 25 watt which I think more sensible, because to carry this charger you need space so in that way user,s may end up buying case or bag for  itüòÇFluid amoled : Its not impressive as super amoled of samsung, might have worked on it.Refresh rate : As stated smooth lag free experience, some amount of lag is there initially while application update. That,s quite normalBuild Quality : Here I need to say that device stole heart in terms of look, metal frame. smooth Matt finish, it feels premium without case. 5/5Camera : even real me is having good camera within 15,000, subjects are completely missing. Optical image stabilization is just another marketing gimmick, Camera is poorFingerprint : brilliantBattery Life : Initially assuming battery life is not right, will update this section.Speakers : loud and clear, stereo speaker enhance multimedia experience. Good for entertainment.Conclusion : Verdict is still missing few essential points like gaming and heating, which can only discovered after the usage of device. Initial impression not that good, but yes clean and blot free oxygen OS is better than miui, color os. so let me complete here that device is good for those who want it considering perfomance oriented device, premium feel, super fast charging, good display and speaker can for media consumption. Go for it anyday.I also attached 4k video samples that is truly adorable, camera is important factor is a huge disappointment. Never ignore this important aspect, sharpness will truly outlastThat is the reason I gave 3 stars

  I have read a lot of comments on phone heating issues and hesitated to buy this device, but i have been using this from 3 days, i havent seen it getting heated.i guess the complete credit goes to the update provided.phone is very smooth and great to use.pros:1) fluid amoled display is very good.2) UI - this is the best part in oneplus phones.3) battery life.4) 65w charging - in 25-30 mins 100% charge which will last for more than 24 hours in standby and for 8-10 hours of screen time.5) SD 870 chip is simply doing its best in speed even with the 120hz display which is very very smooth and great.cons:1) camera can be better for this price range.2) fingerprint is sometimes a bit delay. (not much delay but we can feel it)totally its a worth buying mobile.

  I am using samsung for last 6 years, i have also Samsung Galaxy S8 then i decided to move in OnePlus and really it's a good decision. I am writing this review on OnePlus 9R after using 15 days.....1. Really it's a booster phone with Snapdragon 870 cheapest, refresh rate is high(120 Hz).2. Display & camera awesome. Its support HDR so view in movies feeling better.3. Battery life for medium uses last for 1 days and it's comes with 65 watt charger so speed more than enough.4. Sound absolutely smooth and loud for its stereo speakers and haptic feedback work pretty good.5. Yes! its gaming performance is much more high and touch sampling rate is so good.**Although OnePlus 9R could be better if it have IP rating but in this price range it's honestly good compare to others phone.

  Coming from oneplus 6T, i was highly confused to buy a mobile. I have been using this phone for 15 days now and below is my experience so far:- This phone has brand value. For working professionals, after iphone and other true flagships in android (50k+ range), people recognise you the most with a oneplus device. The appeal on this one, specially blue color is really classy with minimalist branding- This is a pretty well balanced device overall. The processor is really smooth as it is a flagship processor. If you really want sd888, trust me go for oneplus 9 pro (if you can deal with average camera performance) or just wait for more device releases- the haptics are really solid. Before buying this phone online, i went to offline showrooms to get a inhand feel of all 35-40k phones, including samsung s20 fe 5g, oneplus 9R, mi 11x pro, iqoo 7. I really like the haptics of this phone.- The camera lacks some clarity but you really can shine your pics using snapseed. Even when you have an iphone, you still end up using a photo editor to make some corrections if you're really into taking good photos, so in terms of posting pics for online content you can get really good results.- Gcam mod is available for this phone, picture quality is better with the same- The punch hole is really non intrusive, you do not get bothered by it even when playing games or watching movies.- Audio output is really good. Dual speakers give you the surround experience- In hand feel is really solid and well built- The screen is really gorgeous, it is smooooth and produces vibrant colors.Under 40k, go for this one if you are looking for a balanced phone. Otherwise increase your budget and go with Samsung s20 fe 5g.

  Nice phone after using for 2 weeks. No much heating issues like the propoganda seen all over reviewes. I was using Realme 7 pro which was 20K. Good phone, good software but lacked performance and accuracy of sensors for wfh office use like parallely using zoom calls, bluetooth conference speaker integrated, oulook mail and chat softwares running. So I thought I would buy a powerful one and got OnePlus 9R. Good phone, performance and fulils what I want. I like the slider very much. Very handy. Camera is fine for me. Missed the 3.5 mm jack as these bluetooth buds shape don't fit my ear ergonomics. But did I find much change for the 20K I was using against this 40K phone? Not much. Also battery drains in a day wheras the 20K Realme battery was running for a day and half and I am not a game user at all. I thought if I had bought a 30K Realme phone with 870+ processor, think it would have given me what i want and saved a 10K. But no regrets. Nice phone

  I have been seeing lot's of commets regarding heating issues.. i have bought the phone 1 month ago and so far i haven't came across any heating issues I'm a hardcore gamer and i do take photos too. So far all good expect the camera that's a bit off when compared to other phones in the price range i gues OnePlus has realised it and are now rebranding this same smartphone as. OnePlus 9RT whith a better camera sensor almost in the same price range which will be hitting the market soon. so people who are planning to buy this phone don't rush wait a bit and go for the OnePlus 9RT which would be a better option. Other than camer the 9r is a beast.

  This is my fourth Oneplus device after One, 3T & 6 and I am not very much impressed with this one tbh. All other devices brought super value to the table but this one seems lacking in Camera and new features.Camera as in.. obviously it sucks and as far as features concerned my Oneplus 6 has all the same things and tbh feels faster because to show the impact of 120hz screen 9R scrolling slowed down a little on the other hand 6 scrolling is not as smooth as 9R but its faster..I don't need to know whats been scrolling coz I can't read while scrolling and had to stop to see what going on...so 120 hz doesn't matter. Fingerprint scanner sucks..its feels super slow as compared to 6.So overall I would say if you don't care for Oxygen OS and Alert slider then go for something else..as I stick to this only because of these two reasons.

  I was initially put off by all the negative reviews for this phone. But having asked a couple of friends who purchased this recently, it turns out they aren't facing any heating/ battery related issues.The only heating I face is during charging which is somewhat expected.I would advise not to be swayed by the barrage of negative reviews, but ask people who are using it.Overall, it is a good phone but slightly overpriced. I got a good discount with exchange during the prime days hence I went for it.

But i'm facing this problem.Hopefully some cons can be fix through via software, let's see when ONEPLUS will fix it.NOTE: [ If you are looking for a good looking premium performance phone,if camera doesn't matter(it's quite good but not up to my mark), then just go for it. Otherwise if you are looking for a camera phone and performance doesn't matter then dn't go, just buy other brands ]

  This is my first OnePlus device so it's a little special feeling for me to review this. Let me tell you about the pros and consPros- Oxygen UI(best), display quality and refresh rate(next level smoothness), processor(SD870 is a beast), Audio O/p quality is too good(stereo speakers are doing their jobs very well) and battery back is also really good. These are all the prosCons- Camera(Honestly, camera is really bad, even 15-20k smartphones have better camera nowadays, OnePlus really disappointed me in this), Heating (after charging device heats up a bit bit i think it will be resolved with Software updates). These are all the cons.Conclusion - Dear OnePlus, Someone is paying 40000 bucks to buy this device so they deserve a great camera but unfortunately it is sooo bad, it is my request please do something with it via software upgrades.So if you want to a click amazing pictures this phone is definately not for you but if you want a decent camera with beast performance then this phone is definately for you.

  While iphones among the Android is kept for some higher end ones in Samsung members, I think that OnePlus is definitely there. While there is this view that 5G is given in 9R just for namesake, I think it is sufficient. My most data consumption is at home and my Wifi takes care of 90% of my usage. This charger can probably charge an EV in 2 hrs - amazing speed. 12gb RAM is a spec I was pondering for a while but definitely helps me be future proof for atleast a while. Great screen. The from camera on the corner rather than middle is a great design element.I think if you are already in the 25k range segment it's a good step to get into 9R segment.

  The phone works extremely slow, takes 2-3 minutes to delete 2+ pictures selected together, hangs 10-15 times a day, camera is worse than oneplus 5. Ideally, I would want to return this piece of junk but Amazon's policy says it can't be returned. But getting a replacement has become mammoth of a task. All in all, a terrible experience with this phone and Amazon's policies of refunds and replacements because a 40k worth of phone is of no use to me in the first 2 weeks of purchase.

  Editing my review after a month usage.Only camera is different, creates its own color in almost every picture that doesn't look natural. (Rest everything is same, like it's written after a week)Writing this review after using it for a week. Overall a very good product, feel is premium. The only factor which I feel could have been improved is the weight of the phone. It's bit on a heavy side. If you have used a light weight phone then you will feel the same.

  3 days Review. I'll edit down the line.1. Battery - charging really fast. 1-99% in 40min!2. Battery backup - at 120Hz, goes a full day with data on and Bluetooth TWS connected.3. Fingerprint reader - Slow while out under the sun. Average the rest of the time. Definitely not the fastest.4. Camera - photos are decent. Contrasty. Can be managed with Gcam. Videos are really stable. Even at 4K60FPS.5. Performance - blazing fast. No glitches at all.6. Haptics - Top Tier. Really.7. Heating - YES. That's the main issue. While charging or transferring data from old phone to the new phone, it's understandable. But long gaming sessions and turning on hotspots make the metal frame really hot. Like 42¬∞C+.8. Yes you could get a cheaper SD870.  Yes OnePlus has been shady when it comes to timely updates.9. Also, it's a premium experience. I've been a POCO f1 user for the past 3 years almost. So a big jump for me.

  OnePlus 9R is a classy, premium looking phone. I received it yesterday. My first impression about phone in a day usage, is as follows:1) Lake blue colour gives attractive look with stylish camera and smooth finish.2) camera quality is nice, I don't understand y few reviewers are not happy with it. I m not a professional photographer, so for me it's absolutely good.3) Fingerprint sensor works fine.4) Facelock opens even at dim light.5) Phone doesn't heat up during regular use. I observed heating only during initial system update and also while charging which is obvious. Otherwise NO heating issue.6) Comes with wrap charging n charging speed is good.7) Battery performance is good. We have an option to change refresh rate from 120Hz to 60Hz.8) Touch is smooth, and display is excellent.9) Sound quality is awesome.10) Quick gestures response is very fast and I loved it.11) Came with good packaging.12) Back case quality is transparent n goodOnly cons are,If call recording is started, opposite person get intimated about it. Ofc i never do call recording so I don't mind about it.No 3.5 mm jack in this phone just like other costly phones. However, I am using OnePlus buds z for wireless and for wired I use type c to 3.5 mm jack connector. And it Sounds great.Overall excellent features with great display, camera, sound, n battery. No regrets.

  I personally feel one plus is no more the same quality brand what it used to be couple of years ago. 39 k rupees for this phone is truly unworthy of spending. Screen is fine . Camera is not great. Battery surely has to improve and yes there is over heating issues too. In less than week itself im realising the mistake. I feel vivo has more better options than this for sonmuch money.

  I purchased matte black one and God it looks gorgeous in hand. Camera is not upto the mark for normal users but for professional enthusiasts it is good ( Normal user just click  photos in its default settings). Battery backup is excellent (Even after 2hrs of heavy gaming it lasts a day). Display is good. Once u get used to 120hz all other 60/90hz displays look like lazy and lame. Oxygen OS is icing on the cake ( No bloatware at all) Design and in hand feel is very nice. While using ultra wide angle lens edges of the pic will get black circular shadow thing going which I noticed in my device don't know why no one mentioned this issue. Charging is super fast (I personally use optimised charging provided by OnePlus because it improves battery life long term and also fast). While charging with 65watts charger there is a little bit warmth u can feel but not super hot. While gaming it'll get very warm but temperature is 40¬∞ or sometimes 41¬∞ in normal room without fan. I recommend use it with case or back cover which absoarbs heat. On paper it's heavy but it feels the weight is well balanced. No heating issues while using normal day to day apps and social media.

  The performance is awesome and oneplus is always good at it.Only camera performance is not upto mark and this lags all behind. Overall the phone is great. If you are not concerned about cameras just go for it. The camera's are fine. Not as good as 40k phone. But they do job fine. And that's what I wanted. The charging time is 50 mins from 1%-100%The standby battery stays for 20+ hrsWith on screen time of 8+hrsThis was my experienceCall quality is best.Everything is tested under 120hz refresh rate. I can't imagine how long it will last in 60hz refresh rate.Amazing display and speakers are awesome. The haptics are close to flagship and amazing performance.

  Great phone with great camera quality and the 120Hz display make every device I have ever used seem archaic. It is indeed the truth that OnePlus never disappoints, especially when it comes to quality and durability - it is unparalleled. One may suggest that there are cheaper phones with similar description, but having used OnePlus phones for the alot of years, I'd say you cannot give up on quality service and products for a few bucks. It's worth much more than that.This is my fourth OnePlus phone, Oneplus 3, 5, 6 and now 9R!I used my 6 for almost three years and it was the same way it was when I bought it!

  I have been using oneplus seven happily. After getting oneplus 9R I feel like oneplus really degraded its phone quality. That's not what you'd expect after spending 40K.Phone heats badly during first setup. Also camera refuses to take photos sometimes (see attached image) due to high phone temperature. This issue gets resolved after OS update. But still some heating issue persists, though not as severe as first time setup.Build quality: Decent build quality and good display. Call quality is also good.Speed: Quick and responsive.Battery n charging: Charges very quickly and battery is OK. Don't have to recharge.more than once a day for moderate usage.Camera: Image quality is OK. Honestly you'd expect great quality camera after spending 40K but it disappoints. Video quality is pathetic perticularly for indoor videos.Overall a disappointing mobile from oneplus.

  Dislike- i) Sensor quality. Touch sensor is poor & sometimes it has some debug (may be due to software issues in my handset). Once it got automatically restarted after 4 days of buying. ii) If you add 3 Gmail id to get your all contacts - incoming call name display will have lag of 2 seconds.Like- Night-mode camera, Battery charging time (in 30 minutes - 0 to 100%), battery life, calling sound quality.

  Upgrade form 5t to 9rOverall i would sayBattery is really good it gives me 7 to 8 hours sometimes 8+ SOT  and with heavy usage like playing games n all i've got 5 to 6 hoursWhich is decent battery life.Oxygen os is hands down the best ui for android right now so nothing to complaint thereSome minor bugs which are solved by the 2nd OTA update.Camera - so the main concern was the camera and as reviews on YouTube said its not a good camera but after using OP5t and other 3 years old device this is a huge upgrade in camera for me so if you are upgrading From some 3 years or even 2 years old device you'll not dissatisfied with camera in my opinionAnd 5g band as OnePlus said that they'll give update and enable 5g bandsDon't fall for thatThey officially confirmed that OTA will not enable any other 5g band so if you want future proof 5g phone go for galaxy s20 fe 5gDisplay is so good so far as i said if you're upgrading from 3 years old device you'll love this phoneThe only concern is this device is available for only china and India so no global coverage and thats why maybe this device will not have custom rom development more than other OnePlus devices i guess ü§û

  Honest review-A lot of people telling about heating issue so I am just simply adding an honest review, it's a machine not a human ,even human sometimes released heat in forms of Anger.Lol on them who thought gaming phone doesnot release heat. Every machine heated up & its quite nominal.45k you spending what you expect.I am using this for 7 hours and found heating issue which is normal for me .Within a min it decreases almost 4¬∞temp.Iphones also released heat.Heating issue is normal as this is a machine.Thats the reason a lot of reviewers don't talk about this issue.No issue found after 10 days.

  So, I'm new to the OnePlus User. But I'm really love in One Plus Mobiles. I've bought this device with my Xiaomi note 6 Pro exchange offer 6600/- Price Was Fine.Coming to One Plus 9R Review -  I'm writing review  of Purchasing 3rd day of this device . Mobile was awesome actually! No Major Defects and all. I'm in Love with this UI. ‚Ä¢ What I've Observed in First day was when I turned on and Signing to my Google Accounts and Fixing everything my stuff on mobile,At that time I've realised Device Got ""HEAT"" Coz of Usage. Battery Percentage is Getting Down Simply.‚Ä¢ When You turned on device itself You'll get a latest Update, Once you update to the latest. Battery Performance will be Change, Heating Issue Some be Better than Previous!!‚Ä¢ When I'm Playing COD Game, Battery Life was Better. NOT BAD & NOT GOOD. JUST BETTER!! Battery Performance Overall Rate 3/5‚Ä¢ Camera Was Fantastic. Stability Was Good, No Cons On this.‚Ä¢ Cons On App Lock Settings - There is No Option Called ""Device Get Immediately Lock After Closing App "" Once Screen Locked,Then Only App will Lock Or else if You open the App which you kept App lock Option, first time itself it will ask Lock next it won't ask lock if screen awakes!!‚Ä¢ There is no Hidden Files Option for Gallery. Option was there, But not Secured!! Just Like Hidden Album in Gallery which it is not secure. Some Different with Xiaomi Features.‚Ä¢ Fingerprint Reader Was Good. Working Awesome!!

  I got the mobile on 19 April so today it's one month and 6 days.So let's review the phone based on my experience.1. Wrap charger 65 W which is superb and less than 45 minutes your battery will be 100 percent and the important part is the battery will not drain quickly as compared to the speed with the battery charges.2. Looks and feel of the phone is very good . Very smooth finishing.3. Touch sensor are very good with no problem whatsoever.4. Camera quality is very good at day times and all the other functions like nightscape, pro mode and 48 MP camera will not serve the purpose of you are very much interested in photography.5. After using for one week you will feel your phone a little okayish type.So with the price of 44k it's good to search more phones because you don't feel wow after using the cell phone for one month.

  After using the mobile for a week, I'm writing this review.I will be rating each aspect of the phone including the OSI will be honest, intial impressions were prety bad for me because of the heating  and the battery drain issues.Overall experience (4/5): The mobile used to heat up a lot which makes it very uncomfortable to use especially during the first two days. But after some days of use and the updates, it got better.Oxygen OS(5/5): This is my first Oneplus device so I found the OS very clean and snappy.Screen(5/5): The mobile has got an amazing buttery smooth display. Once we get used to it, we can't switch back for other normal displays.Camera(3.5/5): I won't say the camera is bad but it suffers in low light conditions especially the front camera. But the rear camera really takes some good shots in effective light conditions.Build quality (5/5):The phone has a great in hand  feel and it also feels light in weight.For all those people who are holding back thinking of the heating issue.. I too faced them but it subdued after some days.

  My reviews after 10 days use : as a First time One + user..i clearly give a thumbs up to the super smooth oxygen os, the phone built is premium & sturdy. Battery back up : decent  screen time of 9hr. 30 mins, full charging takes  :45 mins. Speakers are awesome, music playback through earphones or Bluetooth speakers is louder . Awestruck by the display, its a treat to watch Netflix on this phone. I find that the network aggregation works well & the internet speed is better. Many of the apps like parallel space, app locks & other utilities etc are inbuilt. I have had interactions with the customer care & the seem to be supportive. The heating issue after the update only remains during camera usage.Cons : The only con I find is  the quality of picture taken by the rear camera. Needs improvement picture becomes over saturated & a bit dark. Selfie camera is nice though. Hoping things improve with updates

  Baring the battery life, the processor, the design, camera and the latest OS are amazing features of the phone. Battery is a bit issue as the phone uses a refresh rate of 120 hz and needs time for optimization. Initially to resolve the issue u can change the screen refresh rate to 60hz from Display - Advanced - Refresh rate. I don't play games so didn't find any spectacular difference in screen by doing so. This helped me overcome the drain and heat issue. Check further details in the OnePlus forum.Will give a 4 to the phone considering price and features.

Fluid display is awesome, thoughtl i have used only limited time in 120Hz (to save the battery), I can very well notice the difference.4. SP 870 is simply superb, met my expectations.5.

When you use camera, it gets heated even more easily.2. Charging speed is not like what they have advertised. It takes 50-60 mins to charge full. Disappointed with the false promises.3. Screen flickering issues while using telegram, notifications, and picking calls. (Hope they'll clear this in next update)4. Screenshots are not of great quality. My old mobile takes clear screenshots than this.5. When you tap 'Mark as read' chat notifications of telegram, they'll be still there. Don't know why.6.

  I bought this phone because I've been a OnePlus user for a long time. This phone is a great phone in the latest line of OnePlus.Battery: It is a beast when it comes to battery life. I use it at 120Hz all the time and I cannot kill it within a day. Warp charging is the chrerry on top.Display: Great display. Great color science. Accurate colors. Viewing angle is great .Camera: Underwhelming. It will get better with software updates (I hope). But as of right now its not good. There is a lag when photo is clicked. Photos come out little muted. I would recommend install Google camera.Software: Best OS other than stock. It's fast,smooth,many customisation options, bit there are little bugs but it's not a deal breaker.Sound: Good quality speakers. They are loud stereo speakers. You get the option of Dolby if you want to enhance your listening experience. Call quality is good no issues.Haptic : Good haptic motor. Strong haptic feedback.Fingerprint reader: There has not been a problem for me. It has worked for me 95 % of the time. It's fast so...no complaint.

  It's just a rebadged version of OnePlus 8T. Was excited at the beginning but got disappointed within a day to have found out its the same old phone and nothing new in it, poor camera quality lot of noise in low light pictures and it doesn't feel premium for the exorbitant price they are selling, though the phone runs smooth. OnePlus you need to up your game, or u r gonna be next nokia. Should have opted for mi 11 ultra for another 15K+ which is comparable to the likes of galaxy s21 ultra.

  First couple of days I faced battery heating issues, but now it runs pretty smooth. As usual, the oneplus camera does not disappoint and does a really good job while taking pictures.120h refresh rate makes this phone very smooth to use and while gaming as well. Overall 4 out of 5 because it does meet my expectation and I feel this is a better buy than oneplus 9.

  If you are someone who uses the phone for calls and camera - you won't be disappointed with phone but camera is utter crap!!I was using a Oppo Reno 10x zoom and I switched over to this phone, still hoping for the reputation OnePlus had in the yesteryears and I was way disappointed with this.1. Phone came with a crappy transparent case, which is of no use - its as good as no case. They want you to buy the sandstone case, they are famous for (or were)2. Single band 5G, not sure if it will work at all3. Camera - yew, the magnification is so limited and the processing is so bad, that ultimately its noise that you see and not the picture. Close ups in portrait mode, does a lot of color processing making you wonder if this is the photo you took in the first place.OnePlus has lost its reputation it once had, many phones are much better out there (I must say, I never sweated about having a Oppo Reno other than the fact that it was quite big and heavy!!)

  I've been using the 128GB version for almost a month now. I took a huge chance by getting it, but I'd say I'm satisfied with my purchase. Oxygen os made the overall usage excellent, highly optimised with a great balance of customisation. As someone who enjoys music and occasional games, I found this device to be amazing. Gets slightly warm when playing cod on maxed out graphics, but very manageable. It's not noticeable with the case provided in the box. I usually go on meetings for 1.5-2 hrs a day, haven't faced a problem with the call quality even once. Vowifi works brilliantly on Airtel in HYD. I found the display to be brilliant color reproduction wise. But I wished the highest brightness were slightly higher under direct sunlight, and the least brightness a lot lower-its way too bright for my liking in a dark room. I was slightly disappointed with the camera, but after using an Asus zenfone max pro m1 since it's launch, I can say this still is not bad at all in ideal conditions. Music output through wired earphones is amazing with Dolby Atmos, just the way I imagined a flagship to be. Earlier reviews mentioned average battery life. After the initial ota updates, I managed to extract 7+ hrs of screen on time consistently with the haptics turned off and 60hz refresh rate, with~20% remaining after 24 hrs. And the best part is, it charges up to 100% in less than 30mins. lastly, I haven't noticed any heating issues after the initial ota update. Coming to 5G, this device only supports one band- when the name prouldy includes this tag.Sorry for the long review, but this would be a 10/10 device if not for the slightly average camera and the lack of multiple 5G band support. (Overall 8.6/10)

  I have been using one plus for more than 6 years now n this is my fiftg one - after purchasing one plus 3, then 3T, then 6 then a nord and now this one.  All of them brought thru Amazon.  All the earlier ones performed well. Infact both 3&3T r still in use. Although service team has denied offering any spare r service for both of them citing products EoL. But that's a separate problem.This 9R I bought on 29th May n put to use from 7th June onwards I must say the phones performance is underwhelming. The said 120hz of speed is actually not felt at all. Infact my one plus 6 is much faster when I use it despite that being a 8 &128 variant. This is supposedly 12&256 but I am not happy with the 12GB ram performance. Even the keypad is very bad. It keeps switching between apps while typing more often and that's damn irritating.Overall my recommendation is to NOT go for this at the price point as the performance claimed is not what you get.Am happy with warp charging though, it's r ally quick than any predecessor. Camera quality is just good nothing great to boast about.

  It's personal my user experience after one week of usage. Best UI, Good display, stunning performance, excellent battery life and fast charging feature too, Overall phone is good but don't expect flagship level cameras.. Infact camera performance is very poor in this phone pic quality and colours of pics coming very unnatural, I'm very disappointed with camera performance, previously I'm OnePlus 5t user after 3.5 years of usage I'm upgrading to OnePlus 9r, i don't think it's huge upgrade for me in terms of camera performance, infact i felt like it's very downgraded one in camera qualitycomparing with previous phone OnePlus 5t it's still capturing decent pictures with natural colours, hope they'll improve camera quality through future system updates...

  Details review for One Plus 9R (1 month Usage)Overall opinion - You should either buy 9R or Pro, 9 is not worth the price.‚Ä¢ The performance is amazing in terms of high end gaming or heavy apps you will not feel the lag.‚Ä¢ The camera is bit tricky to say, It can be 8/10, in the price segment, Low light is ok but not great, Wide angle is great, however macro is 50-50. Overall 8/10 for camera.‚Ä¢ Figer print and face unlock is 10/10. Even with your mask of specs it will recognise you.Battery life is great.‚Ä¢ Charging the phone is suprising super fast. Just 15 min you are good to go. Also, since phone is packed with feature, it do lose battery life bit faster then normal.Overall , it is indeed a good investment in the price.

  Outdoor/ indoor / low light/ natural day light - I have seen that images often get blurry/noisy/ washed eating all the details, lacking sharpness, making subjects dark and what not! Having used one plus mobile for last 5 years and buying this without second thought has been a regret!! But, I appreciate Amazon for providing a replacement as per policy and when even the replaced device may be was seemed better than old still was dissatisfied. I visited the one plus service center where the technician acknowledged the issue and offered a reset to stable OS guessing that could fix issue but i have no hopes and wouldn't want to pass my return window and invite further trouble so requested refund and Amazon agreed to refund but since this was brought on exchange they are adding the exchange value to Amazon pay and say i can use it everywhere where a QR is accepted hope that's the case! Better if it was credited to account or provide an option to transfer from Amazon pay balance to my account! Given that it's the cash earned on my return the customer should have control over it not forced to use it from Amazons wallet, honestly, that's a disappointment!

  1. PERFORMANCE -Well 870 processor working upto the mark I would say.I'm not a heavy gamer anymore but did some gamingLike Bgmi, Nba 2k20 (3 gigs), CodmLemme start with BgmiPhones display runs on 120hz and Bgmi on 60 max for now (software update may change that)You'll feel like it's lagging, well display just shifted from 120 to 60hz sooo it's obvious butFrame rate were constant 58-60 (Hd+extreme)Also Bgmi is buggy and glitchy.Nba and Codm felt more smooth.Score - 9/102. CAMERAOnly weak point of this phone I would say.Let me make this clear first.Not the camera sensor is bad but it's the software optimization that is bad.I attached some photos above you can check.First photo is taken from stock app and later one from gcamFollow the same order for the latter pics.As you can clearly see the difference that pic from gcam were more detailed and contained more natural colour. Dynamic ranges are also good.Last one is from stock cam with little bit of editingVideo - I don't shoot videos much so I don't know for sure but one thing is worth mentioning is that it has OIS that OnePlus 9 doesn't. (So much for flagship device)Again software optimization needed in camera department.Score - 7.53. DISPLAY120hz smooth afVery less tint on display which is known in amoled high refresh rate displayYeah there is pink tint when you view it from charger socket point but no one uses a phone from that angleAlso there are some flickering on lowest brightness also common in amoled screensScore - 84. OSOOS is the most cleanest UI out there in market after pixel uiRam management is more than enoughAnd now OnePlus made an announcement that they will provide 3 major android update + 4 years of security patch updateScore - 9Overall - 8.3Overall very good device

  This how I actually see the phone from my point of view,The phone's processor is very much powerful and heavy gaming efficient.The battery is a major setback, although you turn down all the performance related quirks (like tuning down from 120hZ to 60hZ and turning off the ambient display) in the phone, it still seemed to drain quiet fast. It's just good for a day's normal use.The phone had severe heating issues, like seriouslyüòë, it's ok if it gets heated up during a gaming session but during watching YouTube at 1080 p and Netflix, watching ig reels, n during online shopping like for realüôÑ. The phone gets really hot when charged.Coming to charging, I was actually baffled by the fact that the phone gets fully charged within 34 minutes (prolly the reason why it gets heated real bad) other than that hats iff to 65w charging.Other than that the OS provides a really user friendly experience and provides more customisation to your preference and tastes.The camera is flawless and am not disappointed, but low light selfies can be better.The phone's build is so sturdy and really premium in hand with a metal frame and gorilla glass on the front as well as back.Note: The black 9r provides a matte finish back aka frosted glass and the blue 9r provides a glossy finish.This was my opinion of the phone, as a whole a really good and potential phone with minor tweaks and updates it may take its place in the flagships.

  I received my OnePlus 9r today ie 25 April 2021 and when after setting up the device, I tried to install various apps I found out that a lot of apps cannot be installed. Apps like instagram, Paytm, all amazon apps can't be installed. I had a word at the OnePlus customer care and tried both hard and soft factory reset but the problem still persists. Since we have too many covid cases here in Ghaziabad, going to the service center is not a viable option.Will be returning this phone if the problem remains.Edit: All apps got installed after a patch update. Not replacing the phone, will update the review again after a few weeks.

  My device is a 12GB - 256GB variant, and by experience and score for the device is given below.Design & Build - 3.5 star, very handy and access to physical switches and Back camera positioning is appreciable. In hand, feels like premium. Thickness and weight distribution is good. Phone heating will help to overcome the winter season's extreme cold. Summer season, recommend to use in indoors and in air-conditioned rooms.Screen - 4 star, brightness is good. 120hz smoothness is not much noticeable for a normal user. Fingerprint scanner position in screen is easy to use. Extended use will bring the heat to the screen.Camera - 3 star for Normal, Portrait & Wide Shoots & 4 star for Macro & Video Stabilization & 0 star for Tele and Other features. Night and Panorama shots are completely waste. Close enough to a 15-20k phones. Selfie photos will amaze you !!! , there is no match with real face shape.Battery - 3 Star, Normal user require 2 times charging in a day. Heavy users, plug n play recommend. Over heating is the main thing will get noticed even for Normal users. Recommend to use in winter season for a warm feel in Palms.Charger - 4.5 Star - It is the only thing which delivered the results as per the ADs. While charging also it get warm but need not to worry, it will only take 30-35 min for full charge.Recommend to keep it in a flat metal surface while charging, so that heat will be distributed to the metal and keep the device cool.Overall experience and score - Average & 3.5 star.OnePlus Goodwill is the only thing people are buying this phone. This would be the model which will help the brand to be with average and below average phone makers.Not recommend for Normal users (Hope Heavy gamers understand) if you really want to have this model, Buy Ice water bag along with this, would help to reduce the heating issue ü§™üòúüòù.

  Great Device .Pros and cons are mentioned below:1. Battery life : Very good at 60Hz and okayish at 120 Hz which is very obvious.It would have been better if there was an automatic refresh rate option. I have seen it in realme device of 12_15K price segment  . Found that feature impressive. But sadly it is not in oneplus 9R.2. Screen quality is excellent.3. Camera (Stock) is not satisfactory , but with G-Cam u will be able to click superb quality pictures with natural colours and lot of details in pictures.4. No lag at all. Feels so so smooth even at 60 hz . It would have been better if there was 90 hz option as well , which is intermediate to both 60 and 120 .5. Gaming : Pubg running without any lag . Even in hotdrops no lag was observed. Battery consumption is also satisfactory.6. Charging: The best part of this phone. In 20 minutes it went from 20% to 83% and takes around 35 _38 minutes in 0% to 100%.7: Heating : Max i observed was 39_40 degree C during setting up of the phone.In gaming the temp goes around 34_38 which is perfectly fine i guess.No overheating was observed till now.Writing this review after 3 days of usage.Thanks.

  Disappointing phone..don't buyUsers buy OnePlus devices keeping in mind; fast & stable updates & vfm in general..I've been using the device for almost 4months & I'm writing the review on basis of that. I have no complaints regarding the hardware. But I haven't recieved any security updates for over a month now ( may security updates running in July end). On the other hand other 9 series devices are getting those updates. Keeping double standards is not at all a good practice. Adding to all these 5g bands is just limited to 1 no. Even though Nord 2 has almost 5+ bands & company made a statement that no further bands can be added via software patch... selling a device as future proof is cheating in this angle. MI 11 sells for well under 30000 having same or better spec (display).... keeping the good things like the software experience & general goodies a so called flagship offers is good...but comparing to other devices which offers same specs with almost 10000or even much less with offers is too much to pay forSo plz don't buy OP+ devices...it is not that old OP  anymore specially with color OS integration & not at all vfm

  I would say the phone is okay because I feel it's almost there but it's still miles away from being the best, I saw a lot of stigma for the OP 9 lineup maybe it's true maybe it's not that is subjective, but as far as I can tell phone does get warm at times I think a couple of updates would get rid of the heating issues.The stock cameras are good, I tried the Google cam trust me fellow buyers the quality was magical, im sure it will impress you.One major issue I faced the calls tend to drop abruptly that's one annoying thing im facing.Many major apps need optimization for instance YouTube sometimes doesn't feel like 120hz that's a bummer I want the dev team to address this asap.Frequent times a few apps don't open but give it a moment or 2 it responds.Ahh I hate to say this but the audio output this thing produces is just crap just plain garbage I use expensive earphones like xb75 ap Sony it makes it sound average no extensive settings available in Dolby atmos I demand oneplus fixes this issue.I'm not a great reviewer but this is my honest opinion hope this helps.

  The phone overall is hreat. The camera is good but I rarely use the camera. The best part for me is the 120hz screen and fast charging. 60hz feels like a slower phone now.Many people faced heating issue from what I can see in the reviews but I have not yet faced this.Also I can see many people telling to use the phone in 60hz mode to save battery, if you plan on doing this regularly then don't buy this as they are charging for the screen. To be honest I have never felt the need to use the 60hz mode as battery easily lasts the entire day for me.I am giving 4 stars as the phone could have been 4-5k cheaper or they could have bundled it with wireless earphones because you have to buy it anyways. Once this phone reaches 35k then it will be a great buy. If you don't care that much about the price, go with it!

  Handset is awesome, camera quality is great and front facing can be quite higher pixel range.Smooth and highly slippery which due to gorilla glass also on back.65 Watt Fast charging is really faster, heating while charging is not expected on one plus devices but probably not longs for more than 5 to 7 mins. Full charge done in 35 to 38 mins.Felling heat while using camera, but don't know my friend purchased the same model with one plus 9r is not facing heat problems. Weirded!Battery life is long staying more than a day, I am not a addict user.On screen finger print sensor is really quick and highly responsible.Colour picture and sound quality equalize the headset to higher grade.Finally worthy for money to the brand one plus.Heating problem observed with my headset. Not for the same model purchase directly in one plus store.

  You see that tiny speck in the pic? It's the damaged screen, that I've got on my new phone. This is unacceptable Amazon, Darshita electronics and OnePlus. 43k was what I paid to get a damaged screen on new phone.Edit - I was given a new phone by Amazon. The problem with the first one was,it was a used handset.The phone that was delivered previously did not have a screen guard (the basic one that comes with every phone). My replaced device has a screen guard.

  Worst phone from Oneplus, this is the 1st time I am upset about OP, because there is lots of problems in this phone like, camera not upto it's performance, network issues, when new notification comes and you try to drop down the screen hangs, the music speakers are not good, the only good thing is wrap charging.

  One plus is no longer flagship killer, and it is far from being a flagship phone. I have used OnePlus 5 and then used MI 6 pro before buying 9R. And believe me I am missing mi. It's true that OnePlus has lost its way now, there are no new innovations, one of the worst software I have ever used missing basic stuffs like call history of a contact. I think this is the start of the downfall for OnePlus and my suggestion is don't buy.

  I must say oneplus 9R is definitely grab the deal offer in terms of build quality, haptic feedback, and competitive prices. Yes ofcourse some lack in camera but it's not completely bad at all you will find decent picture in pro mode, dynamic range is also good. 120hz buttery smooth. Oxygen os simply amazing, now come to battery, it will give you almost 12hours for average user. Product is awesome and loveable. On first set up, user will find an update some tweaks. Metallic frame gives you strong build quality the same is not available in OnePlus 9. user will get 109gb out of 128gb.Delivery with 2 days for prime in Chennai.

  It's a bad phone. It definitely does not worth 40k. 25K is more than enough for this.What are we getting in this phone. It just the great software experience. I say, the experience provided by this Oxygen OS is top notch. Someone may prefer this even above iPhone. Such a great software if offers. And screen, you will be amazed and would want to look at it frequently.But then there is nothing. Camera is really poor. I don't know wether this problem is just there with my unit or it's for all but it's there. Even 7T camera is performing better than this. Selfies, colours just seems washed out.Concerning heating issues. It's definitely an over heating device. Even in normal use you will feel that it's warm. I have compared it with some other phone and I observed, even some cheaper phones in the range of 20k are staying cool but this ü§Øü•µThen OnePlus is known for that fast app opening speed. I have experienced it my OnePlus 6, 7T but I don't see it here. Everything feels so slow. I feel I am using a mediocre phone not made by OnePlus.Then there are some bugs.1. Even after selecting preferred calling sim number, it keep on asking it again and again.2. Bluetooth turns on automatically I don't know how.3. Scrolling hangs sometime.4. Screen lock while keeping phone near ear it not great.5. Battery consumption is irregular. Overnight it falls 40% when hotspot is on, sometimes it falls 2%. Logically speaking, on battery saver mode it should not fall more than the time when hotspot was on, but I have seen it falling 10% here.  That's weird.I don't know whether it is just there with my unit or it's for all but I have experienced above problems by carefully observing it.I have applied for replacement of this device. Will update this review if these problems pertain or go away.

Minimal to no heating issues during gaming. Unlike the reviews the phone does not tend to get heated up during usage. Only if you run something like PUBG for 15 minutes will you notice a slightly warmer temperatureThings that could be improved:1. The colors from the camera. Tends to mess up skintones.

  At around 40k one of the best phones there is. My main concern was performance as i dont many photos so i went with oneplus. If you are confused whether to get this or samsung S20 FE 5G, i'll recommend to go for S20 FE only if camera is a huge deal for you. Otherwise OnePlus should be your number 1 choice.Few cons:1. The fingerprint reader sometimes doesn't work, but very rarely does that happen. Like 4-5 times out of 100.2. If you're listening to a video at full volume, the back of the phone vibrates.3. The lowest brightness isn't very low. So at night it might still feel bright for few people even at the lowest setting.

  Great looking phone with great hardware and software. Snapdragon 870 processor gets things done in a snap. Fast charging is great, charge for 20-30 mins and you are covered for a complete day with normal usage. Camera does a great job with natural light as well night light with amazing nightscape option. Top-class product from a top-class brand. Heating issues are noticed during heavy usage and charging, but also depends on room temperature, hope this will be fixed with upcoming software updates.

  The new one plus 9R is a Xerox copy of its brother 8T. In the tech world it's an unwritten saying that you should go with the latest. Hence chose 9R over 8T. Phone is handy for me as I do have big hands, some might find it a little tough to handle. Performance is amazing. Photo quality is pretty good. With some basic photography knowledge you can click the right photo acc. to the sutuation, however if you want better looking (colour wise) pics, you might be interested in getting a higher version of One Plus 9. Battery life is sufficient enough to survive a day and it charges in 45-50 mins when left ideal. If you want to know more in detail, you can dm me on instagram (@the_bearded_chevalier)

  I only bought 9R because Samsung Galaxy S20 FE  5G was out of stock and I needed a phone urgently. OP's glory days are long behind now. After using 8T for 6 months, and 9R for 10 days, here's my review and comparison:1. Display is great, slightly better than 8T. 120 Hz drains the battery too fast. I use it on 60 Hz.2. Battery backup is average on 120 Hz. Great on 60 Hz. I can easily pull of more than a day on average usage at 60 Hz. At 120, I have to charge twice a day. Played CoD Mobile for 5 hours straight with only 30% drain in the battery at 60 Hz.I saw a 75% charge in 30 mins. For some reason, 8T charges faster than 9R. But 9R has a slightly better battery backup than 8T in my case.3. Heating was minimal after the update. Only during charging does it heat up, which is normal for most phones. Even during gaming, the heating wasn't that much, unlike what other users have been complaining about.5. Rear camera is great but underwhelming in low light. Depends on the photographer's skill. Front camera is quite average. Front camera performs badly in low light. Overall, cameras are slightly better than 8T. Or maybe it seems that way due to the better display.Video recording from the front camera is below average and the lack of functionality was disappointing. I can only shoot in two aspect ratios at 30 FPS only. Video recording from the rear camera is good with options like Portrait mode, super stable mode and super slow-mo available. The lack of options in aspect ratios with 60 FPS was another disappointment though.OIS is available in 9R but not 9?! OnePlus is making some seriously stupid business decisions.6. The lack of 3.5 mm jack has been A MAJOR INCONVENIENCE. Good luck finding a connector that lasts long. Or you could buy their earbuds, thats what they wanted you to do anyway.7. Only one 5G band? What is even the point in giving 5G then? Again, stupid. I don't see this phone viable after 2-2.5 years after this when 5G hits the market. Once 5G rolls out, Telcos will reduce the bandwidth for 4G and this phone will sit there like a showpiece. All depends on if n78 band is supported or not. And no, future updates won't fix that, OP has confirmed.8. Phone performance is great though. Everything runs quick and smooth, like you would expect any phone at this price to. Gaming performance is also top notch.9. The fingerprint reader is a little less responsive  than I would have expected. I've seen better response times on some of the smartphones costing ‚Çπ20K. But it is still fast enough.9. The OS is clean and well-optimized. The ambient display options and other customisations are great, just like the 8T.10. Ergonomics are exactly similar to the 8T. But I found the Arctic Blue colour way better than 8T's Aquamarine Green. The Arctic Blue colour looks simply gorgeous.Overall, this phone is not that bad. Kind of good actually, but OP is not the flagship killer anymore. It is trying to sail through only because of its brand value. And lack of innovation and some obvious features is just plain confusing to me. No wonder the previous CEO quit abruptly. If you care for the slightly better camera, display and processor, buy 9R over 8T.Buy a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G if you have a little higher budget, you'll get your money's worth in terms of almost everything. But please don't go for the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro, they're plain bad.

  One Plus is a brand that can be trusted.One Plus 9R is a really good device that will give you a good and proper flagship experience. The camera could be a little better. But still at this price range, there are better alternatives. Don't just buy it impulsively. Check other devices like IQOO7 or MI 11X and think about the device which suits your needs.

  I have been a long time user of One Plus so i can tell with experience that One Plus quality has started degrading. I have used one plus 3, 3T , 5 , 7 and now 9. One Plus 7 was best in the series.I have never faced heating issues in the previous phone until 9R. Not that much but yeas 9R does have heating issues.Battery drains out pretty quickly even after shutting off the background operations and optimized battery conditions.  My 4 year old One Plus 5 has more battery back up than this phone.Overall built quality is fine, so is Operating system - fast and smooth. Camera quality is not great but if are not camera enthusiast, it will serve you purpose.Overall 4 star from my side. Probably this will be my last one plus phone.

  Will keep it simple. Coming from SD 636 to this, it's a major upgrade for me. Multitasking is superb, smooth operations, Oxygen OS is fascinating, 120hz Amoled Display gives wonderful browsing experience. Battery backup around 6-7hrs SoT, warp charging is at another level (around 45mins from 0 to 100). Camera is average, may be below average at this price range (quality at par with 20k phone). Low light captures are awful. If performance and UI experience is the preference, then it's a thumbs up, if the preference is photography, then it's a compromise. And, one more thing, this phone is a beauty, it looks adorable, very elegant and feels premium while holding it (black variant).

  Here's what I think.- The OnePlus being highly customisable is hence one of the best phone manufacturer in the industry. OnePlus 9R being mainstream of the company (For India but still is mainstream) for the April Launch it's made with thorough power and state of art equipments and components.- As being said customisable the camera is best in class hardware which if used with other than stock camera app can be more better than present best (Samples above are from stock camera app)- If your usage is rough and tough this is the piece you should get.....Metallic frame, Metallic camera bumper, Non fingerprint magnetic back (matte finish), decent crafting for in-hand  experience etc. Overall more than premium feel and more than expected protection.- Display too good and you can expect still better in coming updates (OnePlus' serious about updates you know)- Gamers you have a value for money rough and tough phone here, Hard usage, no issues- Battery life is more than decent. Screenshot of my own device is up there. See it you'll just wanna buy it.

  Got it for 34k and writing this review after using it for 1 month. It is the best option in that budget, didn't faced any screen tint issues. Sometime fingerprint is a bit laggy, camera quality is superb but sometimes struggles in low light(front only, as for rear night mode is available). Fast charging just acts as cherry on the top. OnePlus OS makes it work ultra smooth and fast. Network reception is also great with this one and provides with more high speed internet compared to other devices.

  With OnePlus 9r you will get a flagship experience for sure, It's fast, fluid and smooth.In my 4month of usage I have never faced any issues and there is no heating issue with this phone according to my experience.The only part where you will not feel a flagship experience is the camera. Don't get me wrong the camera is decent but it's not as good as other phones at this price range.[Tip: You can use gcam to get better camera experience in this device. In this gcam works much better than its default camera app]Battery life is good it give a one day battery backup easily.

With one plus brand i I assumed camera gonna be best but i was so wrong with one plus 9R. And one plus totally lost it as front camera is better than rear.

  The phone has been absolutely wonderful to use. I will list some pros and cons below.Camera(Con)- One thing this smartphone lacks is decent rear camera. In open areas with natural lighting it takes some wonderful shots, but in artificial or indoor lighting it is absolutely poor and blurry. The front camera is also not that good and if you are looking for a phone with good camera system, this might be a deal breaker for you. Another option is to use Gcam, works really well.Software(Pro)- This was one of the major reasons I went for this phone over the Iqoo cos of Oxygen OS, safe to say its one of the best OS I have ever used and for me, there were a little bugs here and there, however overall nothing major.Gaming(Con and Pro)- This was a phone designed for gamers with the SDG 870. Have had no issue of frame drops or stuttering while playing games. The problem is, it doesn't support playing games at 120Hz even with games which can run at 120fps. For some that might be a deal breaker.Heating- I have seen some reviews where people are complaining about heating issues. I did face about 42¬∞C while playing some games. The thing is SDG 8XX series chipset have always had heating issues. The 888 has an even worse heating issue. So if 40+ degree temps scare u I suggest not buying a Snapdragon 8XX series phones.Display (Pro)- This display at this price point is really good. I have had no issues with it personally. Like the colours are definitely better than the last phone I used. The screen is just bright enough that you can see it in direct sunlight. Can't be a little more bright tho.Fingerprint reader(Pro) - The in-display fingerprint scanner is one of the fastest and unlike the OP 9 and 9 Pro is positioned in a much better spot. Sometimes has trouble detecting fingerprint, otherwise have had no problems.Speakers(Pro)- These are the best speakers you can get at this price, both the speakers are really loud. So much that I normally don't use them at a volume higher than 60 percent.Battery Life- I use 2 Sims and am a very heavy user, I tested it once and it gave me around 7.30 hrs of screen on time with 120Hz on, which is pretty decent for a phone with a powerful chipset. The 65W charger is also there to charge your phone in 15-20 mins from 40-100 percent.Some things I wanna add is that it has a really good haptic feedback, it's not buzzing like the Xiaomi phones, it's a much more firm vibration.Hopefully this review was helpful in your decision of purchasing this phone or not.

  The phone is practically a really good phone.Minor bugs here and there with Oxygen OS but doesn't bother much.Camera photos and videos are really good during day time but struggle at night.Photos soften when you zoom into a pic, that is where the photo loses details but when viewed normally the result is good.Battery backup is decent, you get 5-6 hours of screen time. Screen time depends on the usage like camera, gaming, full brightness.Don't fall into the trap of reducing the refresh rate to save battery, it makes no sense if you have brought a phone for a feature and not using it. The battery is optimized enough for a seamless 120Hz experience.

  I'm posting this review after 3 weeks of my normal usage.OnePlus is already reached some high level in performance. But that's not enough. Most of people mentioned pro's. So let me go with what the issues I faced.Here I faced some issues.Battery charging issue. If the phone is dead if you plugged in charger you have to wait 3 min for starts charging. Until that you can see message like battery too low wait for while to getting some charging. After started charging it won't start charging in warp charge more for again 2 to 3 min. And full charge taking about 50 min. Note: my room temperature under 25 degree. And I'm using proper power supply. Battery discharging is High it can improve. For a normal usage SOT About 5 to 6 hrs maximum. But it can be improved. All the issues can be done via software update.And coming to the camera still poor from OnePlus. Even cheap rate phones doing better job. I'm talking About both front and rear camera. There are lots issue there. Autofocus issues there, quality of the video is not good as it's 40k mobile overall camera quality should improve.Coming to gallery.... I can't believe. I think there is some bugs in it. Preview loading much time and the most irritating thing is if you wanna delete 4 images from gallery you have to wait for 10sec. All the 4 images below 3MB in size. Believe it is running in Snapdragon 870. Still I'm facing the issue after 3 update.Hope all the above mentioned issues can sort out via OTA Update. Other than everything fine. I should mention About oxygen OS it's butter smooth.

  Coming from my Oneplus 5t, the 9r does seem to perform inconsistently. From simply browsing the UI to jumping between apps, there's always a hiccup or two and things don't work consistently.UI elements disappearing, touches not registering consistently, to random app shutdowns, using the 9r hasn't been enjoyable.The screen is great, the haptics are good and the speakers perform well. But apart from that nothing really hits a home run. Camera performance is garbage.

  The phone is really amazing, it gives the feel of a luxury in hand. Best thing is it's warp charger which charges the phone very fast. I have been using it for almost 2 months and never faced a single lag. Battery backup is good even if you are a hardcore gamer. Graphics and display quality is amazing. No purple/pink tint is observed. Black color is better than the blue one.I was using vivo v3 before this phone, so it didn't have a very good camera. Oneplus has a nice camera, however i am not sure if it's VERY GOOD or not because I don't use it much.Speakers are amazing, both upper and lower speakers work simultaneously while gaming that gives an experience of 3D like sound, however some vibrations are felt on the backside but that doesn't really matter.

  First problem_ when someone's call is coming on your phone, then your phone tone will get light but light raat me nhi will burn, if you say silence, you think of the phone when you find out from the light, then forget the second problem when you call  If you want to unlock the phone and wakeup the phone, the screen does not work without double tap, the third big problem is you cannot open the phone with face unlock at night.  Worth it, diagnosing the battery problem, turning the screen from 120 to 60 takes a day or so, but it only lasts, the biggest problem with this phone is that you can't use the Epson printer app in it.  Can only work with wi-fi printer with cable does not connect

  Battery is draining fast even with GPS, Bluetooth and NFC turned-off. Basically you need to tone-down refresh rate amd ambient display to save battery, which eventually makes it a basic phone.

  Even though OnePlus wouldn't like to hear this, but they are way better at making budget flagship killers than flagships, and the 9R is yet another example of that. If you want a super fast phone with clean software experience which looks and feels like a flagship, then this is the phone. Value for money wise, the 9 and 9 Pro, loses handedly to the 9R. The metal frames and glass back, feels premium, the high refresh rate and high touch sampling rate makes the phone silky smooth. The camera experience will be adequate for most users. The 65W warp charging is another extremely practical and useful feature. Keep in mind the 9R is basically the 8T(voted Smartphone of the year 2020- Mrwhostheboss) wrapped in a new design and an overclocked CPU, if you don't really care about the new design, feel free to save an additional 1K by going for the 8T.

  Device is great. Works fast, feels smooth and delivers great performance. The usual specs work as promised by OnePlus.Pros:UI: It is very clean and jitter free. No bloatware, no ads, no bullshit. Although Oxygen OS has little less features than its competitors, clean OS experience has no match!Battery: Great. Easily gives you 5.30 to 6 hours screen on time for normal usage.Performance and In hand feel: SuperbRAM Management: Great to see how it handles lots of apps.Cons:Scanners: Face unlock and fingerprint scanners are good but could have been more better. They fail to work 2 out of 10 times. Also I felt the animations for fingerprint scanner is slow.Speaker Vibration: Speakers are great, but the vibration you will feel on the back side while playing media is a bit frustrating üôÅYou can turn off the top speaker to get rid of it or give it some days you will get used to it.Camera colours: Yes the reviewers were right, the colour saturation could have been better.

  Firstly the cover of the phone --- Its sucks big time, ITNA BADA never settle kaun light hai bhaiya.About the phone :Processor : Its better than any samsung phone with this pricing.Battery : This is the USP of Oneplus phone and it will not disappoint you.Charging : Its like 30 mins nahi toh free....improved and best in this classScreen resolution: I think they need to work  a lot on this still not good...samsung is better and Apple is bestCamera : Not that great..Compared it with Samsung A32..and guess who wins..SAMSUNG..didn't even though of comparing it with AppleHeating Issues: This issue is common in one plus phone have faced in all the model till Oneplus 6T. They have worked on it or may be its a new phone so on first charge the backside was bit hot but it never happened again.Matt finished back side which makes it slipfree.In my opinion with this price there are better phones in the market. One plus has now become Upper middle class phone who wants a good android phone.

  Guys, I have used this mobile set since from one week. I like this set very much. It stands 5 points in every parameters whether you say in performance wise or camera wise. If you are looking in Android and want to enjoy like Apple than don't think anything go for it. I am sure that you will never regret. I play very heavy game call of duty everyday which is nearly 3 Gb game and comes out with amazing performance no lagging no hang problem, run with super performance. Camera quality is very good not so excellent like Apple pro camera and battery backup is amazing and if you charge it from 0 to 100% it takes hardly 50 min.I am very happy with this product.

  Nothing more to say about OnePlus. Who purchases OP they already do the research. Few things I want to share is that:1.Phone is little heavy. I was a Samsung user so comparatively OP 9R is heavy for my hands. I can't see a whole movie holding this phone it gives pain.2.Phone's display is absolutely fabulous refresh rate is awesome.3.No hassleBlad is used in camera but still its a very good camera I would say.4.I have seen a little bit wifi issues. Once wifi network goes it won't come again automatically. Manually I have to disconnect it then reconnect it.5.Phone's body colour variations is very limited.It should be more.Rest of the things are well.I would recommend to go for it.

  Well, this is a good phone. I got this with a exchange promotion offer.Performance wise no issues at all, infact it's incredible. Very smooth like butter. No heating issue, fast charging (taking 45 min to charge from 0 to 100%).Sound quality is good and lound enough.Face unlock works very fast.Fingerprint reader sometimes couldn't read if fingers are not angled properly or dirty. So sometimes you need to do twice or thrice. Otherwise do not cause any issue.Only thing is camera, it has average camera compared to it's price. Take decent pictures. For me it works l. But if you like to click lot of pictures then you may feel that average behaviour of it's camera.Overall a good package if you want a good performing phone with decent battery backup with fast charging, decent pictures, good call quality and primium feel, go for it.I am liking it. It ticked all the features in my list.

  I have been using this phone from past 1 month and it's a good bang for buck . One plus always makes good allrounder phones and this one is no different . Processor is good although it's not the top tier but it does its work . Battery life is really good and charging speed too . Although same old story with the camera but it's usable but not to a person who wants a phone for the camera . Gaming performance is really good , I have played a few titles ( pubg , cod , genshin impact etc...) And there isn't fps drops , just a tad bit , combined with the 120 hz fluid amoled it really bumps up the experience . Overall my thoughts that if you are a one plus fan 9R is the most value for money you will find in the OP 9 series . Final rating are -Performance 8.5/10Battery 9/10Charging speed 10/10Camera 6.5/10Display 9/10Build quality 9/10

  I am writing this honest review after a week's usage. This is my first one plus phone. Was using realme XT prior to this.First of all the packaging and delivery by Amazon deserves a 5 star.Below are my observations- Build quality is very good and sturdy with Alumium casing.-Display is very good. 120 Hz is very smooth to use.-Battery life is little above average for this price if you are a heavy user. Games drain the battery faster than expected. However the 65w warp chager charges the phone very fast and hence this nullifies the disadvantage of battery life. So not too worry about the battery.-Call quality is excellent-Camera is average for this price- fingerprint reader is best- sound quality is very good. The dual speakers is very good experience for watching movies . Dolby Atmos is an added advantage while using headphones- Performance is ultimate feature of this phoneOverall this is a good phone. People can opt for it but its overpriced at least 5k to 6k over and above its actual worth. If cameras were made better it would have been a definite value for money phone.

  No dobt it is powerful phone. You can experience the power of the processor at every action. At 120Hz the phone's performance is simply awesome. Network and WiFi coverage is excellent. Shortcomings are battery drains very fast at 120Hz. Camera quality doesn't meet standards of flagship phone. Overall its a phone of performance lovers and gamers. 1 star less for camera and 3.5mm headphone jack. At this price point these features must be there.

  Switching from Samsung S series was a tough decision to make. But after going through multiple online vlogs and reviews I finally made up my mind to buy one.The touch screen is an absolute delight to use, the phone charges really fast with 65w charger. The data transfer between old and new phones is hassle-free using OnePlus Switch App. The camera's quality is good enough but don't expect DSLR quality pictures. The touch and feel of the phone are delightful.

But when i used it for the first time i could see some heating issue, with this. But it doesn't matters, it automatically cools down. The display really catches the eye, i streamed a lot of web series and movies in it and i really enjoyed, and the best part is the oxygen os, this is one of the best os experience. Overall, it is worth. Go and buy it if your budget is 40k. It is the best smartphone in this range, giving all the best experiences.Buying oneplus 9R is worth camera quality is also good as i had expected in this price range, the night shots are not that good but its recognizable, day light shots are awesome, i couldn't test it properly as its Lockdown, but i had uploaded some.

  One of the best mobile bought by myself. It's huge jump from my existing Samsung A50.Pros:1. Best display ( However I like my earlier A50 Samoled display much, but convinced with this since have 120hz, and 1100 nits bright)2. Battery - Good for moderate used lost for 20- 24 hours with screen on time of 6:30 - 7 hours. If only watching videos screen on time will be about 11-12 hours in full brightness.3. Processor - SD870 what else easily handling the task, PUBG, Asphalt 9 no lag at all. 120 hz display giving super experience while game play.4. Charger - Definitely need to talk about it, super fast hardly taken 35 min 10 - 100%. 0- 100 % 45 min.5. OS - Oxigen OS very new for me from Samsung One UI 3.1. neat and clean OS. Some of the One UI features I too miss like edge panel, all in one hand operations, lots of custom. However this Oxigen OS give me very smooth experience.6. Camera - Something need to be fix asap by 1+, above average but not bad. Perfect colour reproduction no saturation.Other than that sound quality is superb both speaker and headphone, alert slider.Cons:1. Camera - still need improvement2. No wireless charger, no IP rating.3. 1 5G band, hope they will fix with update.Overall very good mobile for my self as a sales manager, it will help lot for day to day operations.

  Phone is good. Company should had pri install some good health tracking apps too like vivo. Secondly it's gaming phone so one plus must had given us some pri installed games.The most important thing the camera quality is not up to mark and snaps cliked is some time worse specialy in low light. No doubt battery charges in approx 40 min but it drains very fast too. Lastly I was using vivo v11 pro which is best phone as ever I used. While spending 44000 looks unjustified.

  Before I start my review on product, I would like to share the delivery experience of the product. I ordered it from Jharkhand, I don't know whether the mailing address is at the last corner of the world or the package is coming from different planet. If these two are not the case then, I belive that the package is coming alone itself by walk. It took ages to deliver.Now coming to the review, after receiving the phone I found that, paint is missing from the bottom left corner of the phone from front side.After truning on , phone starts heating near the camera and it keeps on heating like heating ""NEVER SETTLE"". After installing system update that heating issue reduced to some extent but not that great I would say. It needs more improvement.Battery: Draining quickly. (2/5)OS: It comes few perinstalled app we can't say it as blotware but some of the app like OnePlus apps, Netflix.Camera average. In this price range we can't expect this type of camera. I would give (2/5).Finger print scaner works well. (4/5)Apart from that I noticed that for using dailer or default search option. Phone is asking to accept terms and conditions which doesn't make any sense to me.

Battery backup is average You can easily get 6 Hours of SOT in 60Hz & if you use it in 120Hz you may get around 5-5.30 Hours of SOT. But with 65W warp charge you can get a days juice in just 20 Mins.2. Face Unlock is bit slow & sometimes very late in night or in dark conditions.3. Vibration Near back camera while talking in speaker or listening to music in full volume (Seems all 9R devices hv this prob.)4. While going out and playing heavy games like COD, BGMI & Genshin impact it gets warm near camera area but inside room & fan or cooler is ON it doesn't (Warm not heat).5. cameras are not upto mark as many others under 40k provides better camera sensors but overall you can get decent pictures not very Good.6. They do provide a Non PD charger. Last years 8T comes with PD Charger in the Box but Not 9R even 9 & 9Pro comes with PD charger.7. Price seems higher as Iqoo7Legend Costs less thn Op9R, 7Legend comes with SD888.

  I'm a big fan of oneplus phone Till now I have used oneplus 5 and 6t these both phones are the one of best phones in oneplus. Recently I purchased the one plus 9R 12GB RAM and 235 GB storage phone according to me The phone processor, Display are good charger 65w is really Awesome charging the phone in 30 mintues OnePlus Prove it againBut little more drawbacks are thereThe phone heats up lot when I installed the pre-installed  apps in this device but after that I didn't find any heatCamera is not upto mark if oneplus provide an update for camera that it is very useful. If you are a camera lover don't prefer this modelFace recognition is not good sometime it taking time to recognise otherthan that it is okIf you are Oneplus lover you can go for it.

  It is a good alround phone. The main x factor to buy this phone is the the clean software experience.Although coming from an I phone 11, I find the apps are opening little slowly compared to iphone.Rest the screen of one plus 9r is excellent and great fast charging.Overall I would recommend this phone to those who can spent more and get bloatfree and ad free software experience.

  Its a nice phonePros1. Its butter smooth. Like it's insanely fast.2. Excellent display. 120 hz - HDR support etc.3. Warp charge is mind-blowing. 30 mins to charge is crazy fast.Cons1. Battery life is sad.2. Camera is really sad. I'm not sure if the issue is because of the hardware. But the software ruins the photos even more. It just overexpose every single photo. Night mode is horrible. The weird part is I get better results while taking photos through instagram and snapchat. The only plus point is the pro mode.3. OTA support from OnePlus has fallen over the years. And there next to negligible improvements in the updates. Infact it makes the phone more unstable.

  The camera is very bad . Otherwise the features are good along with the performance but heating issues are there .

  Phone feels light weight. Display is far better than other mobiles which are much costly than 9r. Sd870 is super quick to process. Network and internet speed is much better than other phones. Stereo speakers are of excellent quality and vibration feedback is fantastic. Oxygen os feels vey clean and has many customizations. Alert slider adds a very good feature and phone looks very premium.Camera needs  little bit of tweaking to get very good images. Charging speed is okayish like it takes 45 mins. And battery lasts for 1 day with moderate usgae on 120hz.

  Good product. I wish I could give it a 4.5 because it's definitely better than 4 stars but not perfect.Cons-It gets warm (not hot) while charging, playing games.-cameras are definitely not the very best out there but it's quite good.-not much option with wallpapers.-face unlock works even when I am wearing mask, now I don't know whether it is a pro or a con.Pros-phone feels very fast and snappy-very good display-fingerprint scanner is fast-case that is included in the box is of very good quality-the best thing about this device is the speed at which it charges. I am coming from a samsung phone which took 2.5-3hours to charge fully whereas I just plug this device for 10 15mins for 3 times a day and it give me enough charge. Charges at more than 2%/min.-games run smoothly.-vibration motor is very good-very loud speakers.-phone looks very stylish

It makes phone so smooth.3. Audio quality is superb. Thanks to Dolby Atmos n dual speakers.4. Phone is so light and handyCons-1. According to price range,camera needs more improvement.2.

But this oneplus 9R is has heating abilities too quick while charging, qhile using camera while playing games fir even 10-15 min it heated up. But rest of al factor is good. I know with such process heating is obvious but other phones are not heating if we compare with this.  Other phone heats too but this one rapidly heats.

  Jumping from OnePlus 3 to OnePlus 9 R. Actually excited.Writing it after using for 2 weeks.Plus:Oxygen 11.. slides so smooth.. no bloatware.Playing lots of games by casting to tv. Excellent performance. Battery stays till night.Awesome display super bright. HDR10 videos feel like real.Charges in less than an hourSuper-fast face recognition. On-screen fingerprint scanner is fast too.No heating issues even when playing games.Got back cover in the box so super happy.Cons:Camera is very bad for this price even in daylight selfie pics are very bad.Miss the 3.0 headphone sockets.Could surely cost little less.Conclusion: one of the best phones for gaming. There are multiple options at lesser price tags but if you want a customized Android experience must go brand.

  Good battery, lasts about a day .Camera quality is very good although not best in class.Display is bright smooth and has good colours. Stereo speakers greatly improve video experience.One thing about the camera Is that Ultrawide night shots are not that good..although overall nightscape photos are good enoughMOST OF THE BATTERY PROBLEMS AND HEATING ISSUES WERE FIXED IN A UPDATE THAT I RECEIVED THE DAY AFTER I RECEIVED THE SMARTPHONE...Without the update the battery drains faster and heating issues may persist... But after the update all problems have been solved.Not to mention Software experience is just too good after I switched from Vivo smartphone. No stutters at all and no frame drops...

  Phone looks very premium first of all. Battery life is ok. If u use heavy then it give more than half day of backup and if use normal then easily past one day. And warp charging is best as phone charges fully within 40 mins. Camera quality is ok. Not good and not bad. Heating issues are not much in this phone. It have glass design so it feels slightly warm sometimes but not any major issues now.

  Amazing Device, but comes with it own pros and cons.Pros -1 ) Great software experience with many options to customize.2 ) Blazing fast while browsing and day to day usage.3 ) 120 HZ on this panel feels buttery smooth.4 ) Fast Charging - 0 to 100 in 40 minutes. 0 to 50 in 20 minutes.5 ) 6.30 - 7 hours of SOT.Cons1) Better than average camera. Nothing special considering the price. You can use G cam or pro mode to get the best though.2) Major heating Issues while playing games like Genshin Impact , COD mobile or Pubg in highest setting. ( Since it's marketed as a""gaming phone"" )3) Sometimes heats up with video watching or rendering.

Many times it show no internet while on other device internet work well.Before this, i was using iphone 6. So camera quality is average. It do not show the original colour like iPhone 6.And now OnePlus is no longer independent. It merged with Oppo. So soon it will lose their customers.

  I have the worst experience with the OnePlus product which I placed from Amazon. The display is a bit tilt and which is troubling me a lot. Which ever the screencard iam replacing to my display its showing a huge airgap between the screencard and my mobile display. I even replaced it with OnePlus screencard but still it's showing a big airgaps.. so kindly dont place any orders from the Amazon. And the earphones slot is also a lot troublesome. It's giving a blur sounds and sometimes only the one earpiece works.. so I purchased a OnePlus earphones again but still it's the same. The earphones slot of the mobile has the problem with it.

  I was confused whether to buy this product or not as it had mixed reviews everywhere & finally bought it.After 25 days of using one plus 9R, i can say that it justified my decision to buy this product.This device is a beast when it comes to gaming, multitasking & performance. It is smoother than ever to operate.Fingerprint is by the best that one plus has ever provided but the only thing i have observed is the finger print sometimes function slow when you have a tempered glass on the screen.Battery is OK.Not happy with the camera as all the images has a different & wierd color tone.Go for 9R if you are hardcore gamer.

  Now almost after 86 days of usage, I am totally satisfied with it. Having a great display made my viewing experience great. In fact the charging speed is too good. I won't consider the camera to be bad since I upgraded from a mid range device, and I am satisfied with the camera as well.Now coming to heating, it doesn't have such sort of issues but yes it's natural for the phone to get warmer while charging due to a heavy input. Plus sometimes I've observed that while using social media apps( mostly Instagram), it gets warmer soon.And coming to tint related issues, there is no such but I think some devices have found it. So, it might be specific to some devices.So for me it's a great device!!Now If

  Rigorously used the device for the whole day with no overheating issues. It does get slightly warm when gaming and charging which is normal I guess. Would have given the device a full 5star rating, but for the Camera. The image on the camera app before capturing looks way better than what is actually captured, the cyberpunk filter is just a gimmick, and the nightscape is just pathetic. If the camera is not a big deal for you, I would definitely suggest this phone.OnePlus, please tend to the camera issues. Expecting the camera software to enhance over time by updates. üëç

  ¬†I've been using this phone since 2 months now and so far no issues probably the best phone in this price range. I'll say just go for it. If you are concern about battery issues so far I haven't seen any. I play alot of BGMI it doesn't heat at all. It heats up a little bit while charging and that's because of the 65 watt charger guys so it's nothing to worry about since no other phone is giving you a 65 watt charger which charges like 0-100 in 25 mins. probably the best deal I ever had.

  Phone is not worth of money we are spending on it. There are multiple issues in it.1. Phone heats up while charging or on calls longer than 40-50 mins2. Gallery app is quite slow. Simple cropping a image take 20-30 secs. Deleting 100 photos takes more than 2-3 mins. No Application update for the same yet.3. When I switch from one app to other app which is already open in background, screen blanks out sometimes. It takes 20-30 seconds to load the other app while switching.Buying such a costly phone shouldn't give such performance issues.

  Been using it for more than a week. Didn't find any issues at first but I felt battery drained a little quicker and there definitely is a heating issue... not the solid smartphone I expected OnePlus to provide us with at a high price... Pretty sure this is better than the other overpriced 9 series phones.

  A perfect balance in everything except the camera quality. I am a heavy user and a long-term Samsung User I usually don't like Oneplus. But, as far as price is concerned this phone might surprise you.Verdict: If your budget is 40k and if you don't use your camera that often then simply go for it.

  Everything about the phone is awesome. The only con/area of improvement is battery. They have to optimise the software even more to make the best of battery. Rest everything is phenomenal. There's no heat, no lags.

  I have been using this device for about a month now.I have shifted from ios to anroid for the first time and the performance on this device is phenomenal. No complaints about the performance.Camera is average nothing too goodHowever the battery backup on a single charge could have been a lil better. The fast charging is a great feature to have but quick charging also drains early.All in all a great device from Oneplus üëç

  This phone was an overall upgrade from my pervious phone - so i am happy with all aspects of its functioning. Display, battery life, speed, OxygenOS etc.You do pay a of bit premium as compared to other phones and i think thats coz of the OnePlus build quality and brand value...I do miss the 3.5mm port though, I wish OnePlus would have considered it when designing.

  I have purchased OnePlus 9R lake blue (12-256gb) on 3rd June 2021, Used for around 27 days till now,Facing some issues which need to be improved immediately....1. Unknowingly bluetooth and location turns on automatically & unwantedly wherein they are not under use for any app installed.2. Heating issues, I feel like this phone will blast like Samsung phones previously there were some instances.

  I have recieved today so it's too soon to share complete authentic review. Few things from day 1 experience1. The metallic body looks good.2. Battery is good3. Camera is 3.5, like average not best. Better than Nord.I'm satisfied because being a one plus user when I switched to other mobile brand it was very disappointing. My 3T lasted for 4 years, so with more time will be able to analyse 9R's performance.

  1st day review..The battery got charged in 40 min approx, when the phone was off....after that the battery drained drastically from 100-70 in just 3 hours without any heavy usage.Battery is a disappointment...I want to return the product, but amazon is not allowing, so had to raise a technical visit. Let's see.My old phone with 3000mah battery could outrun this device easily.....

  Face recognition sometimes works even when the object is 1 to 1.5 ft apart which I feel is not good from security perspective.Fingerprint sensor is Swift but shows error  sometimes even after pressing the button accurately.Sound quality is good. Screen quality is good.Performance is good.Camera needs to be improved for this price range.Moreover I feel this device deserves a price of less than 35k with the given features.

There are some issues with some apps which I have complainted in the OnePlus community,btw the cost of the phone is lot lot higher for features which there in the phones which are below 35000 but this phone is 45000 for no outstanding features other than it OS
