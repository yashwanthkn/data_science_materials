  My first time buying a OnePlus phone and I really like the finish of the one. Camera is excellent, Android 11 is very smooth to use, functions are fast.Just my first day of usage so hard to be critical of anything. The downside for me is that there is no place expand the memory.---Updating my review after 100 days of using. Bought on April 19th updated review on July 29th.Super fast charging.. 30 mins and goes from say 30% battery to 100% battery charge.I also bought the OnePlus Buds Z along with the phone and these are great quality. Connecting the buds sometimes is an issue. Sometimes it will connect automatically and sometimes it will not detect.Overall I still love this phone though I think its a bit heavy and large screen for non-gamers.

  HiPlease consider this message with a serious note the One Plus 9R which was bought on the above mention date got hanged and did not open exactly on the 13th day of buying it. The replacement policy was only for 10 days and my phone showed prblms from the 13th day. I took it to the One Plus Care Centre and they said it needed an update i waited for 3 days for the 'So Called' update to arrive but after 3 days the Care Centre informed me that this phone needed a Motherboard change when i ask them to replace the phone, they said that the care could not replace it for a new one because i had bought from amazon. They are now suggesting to replace it through amazon only. Is this what i bought a 40k One Plus phone for? If i can only tag the Oneplus company people in this!!!!!What kind of mobile phones do they sell???And also i want to claim a replacement of my phone from Amazon....i just dont care if the 10 days return policy is over.... I just want to say that i bought a 40k worth phone from you guys... And that it doesnt work...been waiting for more than 7 days now....with a ""Dabba"" phone in hand..... Is this the kind of service you provide??? I really would like you to have my phone replaced at the earliest Reply back soon......

  Writing after 4 Days of use1. Heating Issues -you will start noticing from the very first use2. Battery - charges 0 to 100 in just 35-40 mins but also drains so fast. Need to Charges twice in a day after using whatsapp, some browsing, calling.3. Camera - Not very good. Less than as expected. Think twice before buying if you are camera enthusiastic.4. Smooth- 120hZ and 60hZ both condition works well. I found it smooth to use and open apps5. Snap 870 processor really works.6. Other Oneplus features works good.7. Not a flagship phone.Money and Decision is yours..!!Thanks

  I am writing down this after using for a couple of days. I got the carbon black one with 12GB RAM.  Overall the device is good, and honestly is the reskin of one plus 8T with lower price üòÅ.  I will list down the pros and cons -pros -1. With Oxygen OS 11, the overall user experience is quite smooth. You will get an update as soon as you finish setup.2. The Warp 65 fast charging is fine, takes around 35 mins for one full charge.3. The screen to body ratio is good.4. The matt finish on the back side is awesome.Cons -1. Battery drains a little fast, not sure if some future updates will fix it.2. Rear Camera is ok, can be better.3. I would have preferred popup front camera, rather than the punch hole.4. For dual apps, I would have loved to see the option for all apps. Right now it has support for few.5. support for few more 5G bands will be good to have.

  Disappointed. This was my first purchase of oneplus phone and I was so eager to get a hand on it. But seriously there is need for improvement. Battery is like a candle as it is draining easily. Product has no premium finish. Also the display is not up-to the mark. They're claiming it as a gaming phone and sorry to say that you can't use it as a gaming device. Also the camera is average. Please don't go for it as there are lot of other good smartphones in the market with same set of features for 40k. Big no from my side. One plus Nord is better than this and I would recommend One plus should call back entire.  9R series.

  An overall decent phone. The clean software experience would be the reason to choose this instead of Mi 11X or IQOO 7. Hardware wise it's more than capable. The camera I would say , is decent. It depends on your photography skills. The sensor specs only matter so much, I would say invest some time in learning photography. Check the photos attached. If you are a power user , this is one of the best value for money phones at this segment. For the custom rom folks , the kernel is open sourced, so in a year can expect decent ROM. I think IQOO bootloader is not unlocked so keep that in mind.

  As I'm a OnePlus user for more than 4 years now I purchased the OnePlus Plus 9 Pro on 30th March and loved it.And got the 9R for my sister and she loved this phone.I would say it's better to get 9R over 9 else buy the 9 Pro.Camera on the 9R is not as people are saying that it's bad. It's decent for the price. A normal person can't tell the difference btw.Screen is beautiful, phone looks premium.

  ¬†Okay, First of all, I was using oneplus 6 before and was planning for an upgrade, and eagerly waiting for 9 series. I decided to buy Oneplus 9 first, then I came to know that it wont have OIS stabilization. Then I planned to go for Oneplus 9 pro, but !! Insane heating issues and battery draining problem.Why should I waste money for such a phone, and finally I bought Oneplus 9r . Folks Hazzelblad is just a gimmick, Anybody using Oneplus 9R can get the same output using Google camera in OP9R !!Speakers are really good, Dolby Atmos, Cameras are above average+ , Super stable video mode gives you iPhone like stabilization, gaming is supercool, I bought 12/256 varient, and its super snappy, butter smooth. The only struggle I'm facing right now is the availability of accessories like tempered glass and back cases (official glass and cases are really expensive) , and we know this is a new model launched days before, so hopefully it'll sorted soon !!

May be because of fast charge effect, OnePlus should look into this. After 100% charge, it automatically get cooled. no heating issueAs others are complaining there is=> No display tint issues=> No heating issues while using the phone, gaming etc. But noticed while charging=> No charging issues, within 10-15 mins 60-70% chargingRear Camera is good.

  I just switched from OP6.Unlike when I brought the OP6, when I had zero complaints. I'm having many issues with the OP9R from day one.Things to note:1. The display has some major issues, there's an off-axis pinkish tint to whites and grays, which is quite annoying, and almost all the devices seem to affected with this as per OnePlus forums.2. The Camera are just mediocre, and I find the OP9 Camera much better than this. Even though OP9 lacks OIS, it almost always catches better pics and has better focus and stabilization in videos. Like MKBHD said, the Macro and Monochrome sensors are just garbage.3. The whole of the phone, particularly the backplate vibrates on playing sounds, it's pretty annoying and makes the phone feel cheap.Good stuff:1. Warp Charging is unbelievably fast.2. Other than the off-axis color shift, it's a great display.3. The phone is very snappy, added to the 120Hz display gives it a very confident smoothness.Overall:I think OnePlus put very little effort to this phone, as if they made it just to satisfy the Indian customers to complement the OnePlus 9 series. Their quality control seems to be quite bad, as OnePlus forums is full with issues with this device. I have a very unpopular suggestion, buy the OnePlus 9, it's only 7K more (SBI Credit Card). You get a newer and efficient Chipset, a substantially better camera. Having OIS gives no seeming advantage to OnePlus 9.

  Ordered Carbon Black; 12GB+256GB variant.Recieved a day early, on 19 April 2021.First Day Review:This phone is basically an 8T but with a Snapdragon 870, at a lower cost, but that doesnt mean they skimped on quality.So far from 1 day of use, this phone has been incredibly snappy and intuitive. Switching over from a Galaxy Note 8 was a piece of cake, although it took a good few hours to transfer the data.Charging is really quick as you would expect from a 65W WarpCharger.Camera quality is satisfactory in Auto mode, and gets better in Pro Mode with manual control.Speakers are loud and clear, and there is enough stereo seperation that it doesnt feel too unbalanced.Screen gets really bright and colours are accurate, haven't run into any rainbowing, Black Crush or Purple tinting issues. The 120Hz refresh rate also adds to the snappiness feel of the phone.Gaming is really enjoyable, especially those game that take advantage of the features like haptic feedback in COD Mobile. Speaking of which, the haptic motor (vibration) feels super crisp and tight, giving it a premium experience.I had gone for the Carbon Black, and the matte finish on the back glass is exactly what I had hoped for, and the matte finish also has an advantage of repelling fingerprints.So far the phone has been awesome, and I recommend it 10/10.Will update this review if I notice anything off :)

  The only reason I went for Oneplus 9R is that I have been using Oneplus 5T from last 3+ years, the phone is perfectly fine till now and I always wanted to go with Oneplus for the upgrade after using Oneplus 5T and for its great user experience.Coming to the Oneplus 9R, I am not totally satisfied with the phone as I had higher expectations on Oneplus 9R. With the given features and upgrades I feel the phone is not doing so great. When you compare this phones with the similar range of phones from other brands you will have different opinions and thoughts.Pros:- Display quality is very good, with Fluid AMOLED Display and 120 Hz refresh rate display it is buttery smooth- Built quality is great, with aluminum body and Front and back Gorilla Glass 5 protection. Feels premium in hand- Phone speakers are doing well, sound is crisp, loud and with more details- Handset microphone is also great, Can hear the exact voice of the caller and it's clear and loud- Performance - Qualcomm 870 Chipset is doing well, phone is running smooth with no lags so far.- Front camera is good if you compare with other 16MP sensors on other phones.- As usual clean UI experience with Oxygen 11 OS.Cons:- Minor heating issues.  Felt phone was heating up during initial setup, while moving the files from old phone to new one. first 2-3 days felt phone is getting warmer with normal usage aslo and during the time of charging. I feel the heating issues resolved after receiving the first OS update or who knows the phone might be settling down after few days of usage.- Primary camera(s) is not up to the mark, photos can be seen only better in pro mode, videos are little better and front camera is OK. Lots of additional and unnatural colors are being added to the shot. There is no much clarity when you zoom and no details and images are scattered. Camera is not good with the hype which Oneplus created.  I wish Oneplus would be able to fix the camera issues with some good updates if hardware supports and if not then that's it.-Battery backup - Battery drains very quickly with the 120Hz refresh on, battery lasts only for 1 day with full charge and optimal usage. But the good thing is, it charges very quickly as well with 65W Warp charger. from 6 to 100 % took 49 minutes to charge.Overall, if you want to go with the display and performance other then Camera quality and some other issues which I highlighted, then you can go for it and if you are an Oneplus fan.NOTE: Whoever wants good Camera, they might think twice before purchasing this phone. You will get way better camera phones than Oneplus 9R under 40K (38 with discount).

  OnePlus did a blunder with this one. Battery quality is very bad. And it's charging very slow. I'm not sure it's some unit problem or software issue, so I've requested a replacement, but it states over 1 hour to full charge when it's already charged 60%. The charging rate is very low as well, and battery deplete very fast, I can say it depletes faster than it's charging rate.Screen quality is great.Sound quality isn't very good either, it has very less max volume, I literally had to keep it at full volume always for a decent sound.As for heating issues, as everyone else is stating, it's over heating a lot! While normal usage it overheats, let alone any power playing.Honestly, I feel OnePlus made a blunder here. I was really looking forward to this device. Let's see how the replacement unit feels.Edit - battery seem to be performing better after replacement. However, still have issues like overheating and speaker sound.

  The OnePlus 9R is a fair proposition in terms of the phone's pricing. For Rs 39,999, I get great performance, along with a very fluid and clean software experience. The photography, especially in low light, might not be spectacular, but it's still pretty good. Fast charging, decent battery life, and an attractive design contribute to the OnePlus 9R being a great purchase decision.

  I have an OnePlus 3 and an One plus 8 and this this my third purchase of an oneplus phone in the family.A bit disappointed to hold the phone at first after using OnePlus 8 for almost a year now. First, the lack of curved edges deprives you of a smooth navigation gestures especially with the cover on. Further, it is not the slimmest phone in this price catagory. But not so heavy.Full marks to the Super-AMOLED display, which is super cool and crisp. Even in broad sunlight, it is visible because of the 1,100 nits it offers. Build quality is very premium. Ergonomically well designed. Perfect for one-handed opraration. The front and rear is of corning gorilla glass 5 and the frame is metal (where as for the OnePlus 9 the frame and rear are of plastic!!) Lucky me! So it looks very elegant. But no IP rating for water proof is disappointing. But company says it is water proof. The insulation in the SIM tray is an evidence.The phone is superfast with a great sensitivity for touch and swipe gestures with the Snap Dragon 870 processor. 120 hz refresh rate is super smooth. Gamers would love it with a top-notch haptics (vibration features) and with the 244 hz touch sampling rate.Battery charging is very fast too. The juice holds up for quite long because of the better power management by the latest processor and the LLDR 5 RAM. Delightful!! Occassional warming yes during heavy games. That's normal. Camera is decent. Front camera is 16 MP should be a 32 in this price range. Avoid beautification option as you may look like a cartoon. Rear camera takes above average photos in day light. But below average during low light/ nights especially the wide angle camera. But it has optical image stabilisation even the OnePlus 9 doesn't have that. So shaky hand fellows don't worry for the blur. Videos are of best quality. Best in this category. With a good video editor and skill you can make cinema like videos but the stabilisation is not-so-good in the nights.Stereo speakers are of very good quality. It is loud and doesn't crack even at high volumes. Call quality is decent. Not comparable with iPhones though. And Dolby audio is very enjoyable with headphones. With a good quality earphones/ headsets, I assure it is not less than a immersive audio experience especially for games.'Flip to mute' and 'raise the phone to answer' features are missing. Don't know why. It is just a OnePlus 8T with a good looking rear camera console with Rs.3000 less. Even the cover of 8T suits perfectly on this.So overall I am satisfied if not delighted. My OnePlus 8 is still better I feel. But this is the best in this price range. Better than the vivo x60, Mi11X pro or even the samsung S20 FE especially for the build quality and the premium feel it gives. Also the oxygen OS is best out of all android OS'. Also the in-display finger print sensor and the face unlock, I have not experienced  anything faster, prompter and more acuurate in recent times with anyother gadgets!! But the phone has only one 5G band. Suggest not to use the cover supplied with the box. It gives a kinda smoky look and makes the phone look bulky. But withstands accident falls. I have ordered the sandstone bumper case from the OnePlus store. Lake blue colour variant is awesome. Best of all the colors of all the OnePlus phones till today in my opinion. Catches not much finger prints or smudges like the 8 series. Scratch proof. Phone comes with a pre-applied scratch gaurd sticker. So no extra purchase required. Charging cable is a bit shorter than OnePlus 8. Type C charger with 65W charging adapter. 0 to 100 in 50 minutes. One significant change here is the data transfer to and from computer is quite faster than my OnePlus 8 also using OTG. Adaptive brightness they have got it right this time. In previous Oneplus devices, it was irritating. I have become loyal to OnePlus because the life of OnePlus phones is quite long compared to any other leading brands. My OnePlus 3 still stands formidable after 5 years. One star less just for the absense of curved edges display and a not-so-slim thickness. Else this phone is very good. Though corner of my mind says the price should be 10% lesser.P. S.Not encountered any overheating or battery draining issues as highlighted by some users. May be because I bought the phone after the release of first software update  and updated before writing this review. If you are not a fan of flagship processors and not a gamer, go for the OPPO F19 Pro with half of this price. Slimmer, lighter and with 3.5 mm jack.

  Review after 7 days of extensive usage.¬†‚Ä¢¬†I would say the performance you are going to get one oneplus and that OxygenOS touch you gonna get from knowhere. It's too smooth to handle after using this you'll find thise ""IOS"" devices are lagging cuz they aren't having 120 Hz display even the price for iphone 12 is almost double the price of oneplus 9R.Pros:¬†‚Ä¢¬†Snapdragon 870 which is smooth as hell either it be for video editing and redndering or it be for playing games. Even the ""Call of Duty"" runs like water buttery smooth at max fps.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Tested this device while playing games on it like COD/Free Fire with max Resolution and FOS and would say thermals are very good it won't heat up after almost an hor of gaming temp was still maintained to be as 40¬∞C in a Non AC room.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Video Stability and recording best in the market if you turn night mode on even in the dark scenes it is well lit up no one can guess it was shooted in night. Video potrait is best for content creater the bokeh effect is mouth watering for the content creators the bokeh youll get is as similar as you'll get in a dslr camera but the surrounding should be well lit up.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Oxygen OS it is the best operating system I've seen on an Android device unlike other OS available for Android.¬†‚Ä¢¬†User interface is best thing of oneplus devices you can't get rid of it's addiction even you'll start hating IOS üòÖ not actually but it's the best UI I've ever used¬†‚Ä¢¬†You'll get 5g support so you don't need to worry about future upgrades. This will work smooth.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Design and placement of Camera Module is the best the oneplus have done ever while it's completely subjective, but youll get ü¶ç Glass 5 protection on front and back along with a aluminum chasis/side frame it's a well built device simply rigid and feels premium to hold.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Haptic is best in the price range.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Dua Dolby Stereo Speakers make it loud enough to consume your content at any place¬†‚Ä¢¬†Full day power just in few minutes this device comes with a 65W wrap charge which will charge your device in just the time span of 30/35 mins. You'll never fall short of power either it be powerful performance or the power interms of battery.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Oneplus's Fluid Amoled display is best screen I've ever seen smooth responsive and vivid best for Netflix, lovers xD.Cons:¬†‚Ä¢¬†There are some bugs oneplus need to solve it as it isn't justified for this kind of flagship devices. I'm mentioning few of them oneplus pls act accordingly.¬†‚Ä¢¬†While using YouTube  the framerate drops I don't know it's a google fault or what but even the notification bar seem to be freezing while scrolling down as to like 90fps. There are few more applications like Google photos application which I've discovered uptil now.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Phone get warms outside it might be due to the electronic devices catch too much of heat radiations from Sun rays.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Oneplus pls provide One-Hand mode as soon as possible as the device is having a large form factor it's quite not possible for using the device single handedly even if I am having really large palms and long fingers indeed, I am just thinking anout those girls having small cute palms and fingersüíÖü§£üòÖ.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Now jumping to camera section one plus needs to work on the picture capturing algorithm the problems faced were like...¬†‚Ä¢¬†1) Sometime captures undersaturated photos in potrait and 2x Zoom mode.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Need to work on the algorithm of focusing as it hunts for focus sometimes in the darker.¬†‚Ä¢¬†Basically Camera needed to be well optimized by oneplus in few aspects rather say camera performance is awesome just few bugs are needed to be solved. I've attached few pictures you can refer to those.Conclusion:¬†‚Ä¢¬†If you want a well built phone with best processing speeds and Video Capabilities you can opt for it it's is the best device in my terms under 50k budget but few bugs and improvisation are required & I hope Oneplus will donit sooner or later.Thanks for reading my review.

  None of the features are good and looks really cheap. If you're OnePlus user do not buy this any of the 9 series it's only a trash.Picture quality is very low if you click snap you'll feel like you took a picture from a cheap 3k mobile. Worst phone ever regret the decision to buy this shot.

  I have been using Realme 2 pro for the past 2 and half years and I felt like I needed a upgrade and bought OnePlus 9R, have to say it's a worthy upgrade and the speed is amazing. Everything is super fast and 120hz refresh rate is cherry on the top. Camera is okaish nothing that great. There are some heating here and there while using apps. Battery is okay as well. If you are using heavily it will not last you for a day, with normal usage it will easily last for a day. Also the phone fully charges in 40 minutes thanks to the 65w fast charging. OxygenOs is good nothing that great. There are lots of booklets inside the box, I hope next time OnePlus reduce that and instead add a usb c to 3.5mm jack adaptor. This is the first time I am using a OnePlus phone and I am really enjoying every moment of it and I would recommend this phone to everyone who is planning on upgrading their phone.

  This is the best smartphone you can purchase under 40k...I researched alot and found out it is way better than iqoo 7 legend and S20fer..In Iqoo you can face after sale service and in S20fe you are getting plastic back, slow charging, low brightness and laggy uiThis is my first time using OnePlus device shifting from Oppo K1, the best thing about this phone is the build quality and oxygen os.... beleive me if you once use oxygen os you can't shift to other UI easily, Oxygen OS can be the single reason to purchase itPros :- Performance beast, no lag at all anywhere- BGMI working great in 60fps, soon it'll get 90fps too- Build quality , it's feels premium in hand- Display, the colors, brightness are awesome and cherry on the cake is the bezels it's almost negligible compared to other devices in this range- Haptic Feedback is of flagship level- Battery backup is decent for 1 day use and 65 watt charger is also a plus point, it charges 0-100% in 40 min- Stereo Speakers is best in this range- Indisplay Fingerprint is lightning fast and especially it's placement is even better than that on 9 proCons :- Bit heavy, maybe because I shifted from 156 gm device to 190gm, but you'll get use to it- Camera is the only weak point, front camera is just average, yes the back camera 48 mp does it's job especially in video recording, it gives the most stable videos compared to any other device in this range... only the picture quality is not that great compared to S20feConclusion : If you are very camera centric user and want IP68 rating, avoid 9r and go with s20fe, else in everything OnePlus just kills S20fe easily and don't go with iqoo 7 legend just for 888 , 870 is almost as par as 888... Thanks for reading do give it a like and have a nice day

  You may get phones with better on paper specs at this price, but none have this quality. The build quality is significantly better than the competition. The frame is aluminium with a glass black and premium looking matte finish. Oxygen OS feels simple, practically useful and premium unlike those overwhelmingly bloated skins in Xiaomi, Vivo and Samsung phones. The phone has a great display, much better than the competition. The vibration motors are Iphone quality, not the usual cheap quality vibration motors found in the competitiors. The battery life is much better than advertised. I am able to get 6 hours of playtime on heavy games like COD Mobile on full charge. 65W fast charging is stupendously fast. No heating issues whatsoever even while gaming. Buttery smooth performance in daily usage as well as games. Idle battery time is amazing. The cameras are great but lack in colour calibration. Other competitors offer better cameras. Overall, Oneplus is the only brand offering clean software experience in this range, which is the most important thing in a phone.

  Extremely slow and disappointing product. I have been using OnePlus since they launched OnePlus One. And this is by far the worst product I have ever seen for the following reasons1. Display screen blinking again and again2. Burning hot after just two hours of use3. Battery life is pathetic, only lasts 6-7 hours before needing charge again4. Unable to perform multiple functionsI would never recommend this product to anyone. I'm officially not a OnePlus customer after this.

  I felt like this oneplus 9R is Best in oneplus 9 series. It's worth of 40k. The 65w warp charger is just amazing that your phone gets charged from15% to 100% in just 38mins. I did not not felt much heating issue. Frequently close the recent apps and clear the cache. If you strain the phone too much it will obviously heats. Camera is fine but not a wow factor. Display is just amazing. Phone runs pretty fast with Snapdragon 870. If you are confused with 9, 9pro and 9R, would definitely recommend 9R because it's worth the penny. 9 and 9pro doesn't make any sence with the hasselblad. Not much different with the cameras. It's seems just a hype. Go for 9R you would save 10k comparing with the other 9 series.

  It has been more than 3 months since i am using OP 9r. I have ordered it in first sale.So i must say everything is fabulous in this phone whether it is looks, performance, display Or Camera. Don't get confused when i say camera is great because many of the big youtubers have criticised its camera when compared it with Samasung galaxy s20 5G.So after seeing comparison i thought to switch to samsung galaxy s20 5G. So i decided to go to samsung store just to check if it is that good. And trust me guys, S20 looks way cheaper and like a normal phone. The time i took it in my hand i decided to stay with OP 9R. Even i have compared the camera as well and have not noticed any difference. So for normal users, if you are not a tech enthusiast, you won't be able to find any difference between two when it comes to camera. And please don't trust these youtubers. They are just making money by making us fool. Before making any decision just visit to the samsung or oneplus store.And as of now, i have not noticed any con in this phone. Everything is smooth specially the display. Also there is no heating issue but gets little warm during the charging. Battery life is also decent. If you are a normal user it will last one and half day. Also, it takes 40 to 45mins to charge it fully. So if you have the budget, then go for it. You will not regret it.

  Switched from One plus 5T.Slight overheating issue but that was the case with 5T as well. I am not a high end gamer but a general user, reading work emails, scrolling social media and playing card games.- The UI is amazing, very smooth as compared to 5T.- Camera is good at this range but not to be compared with phones which have camera as the sole USP.- Battery Backup is quite good with me staying on the phone all the time, it dropped from 100-30% in a day of full usage (and some board and card games)The options I compared before buying it:1. Samsung FE S20: Probably the only switch I could have done, but my experience with 5T helped me stay loyal to One plus.2. IQOO 7: Performance and feature wise, slightly better, lower price too. One plus suits social status and IQOO is a newer brand still building it's reportaire.3 iPhone 11: Old vs new dilemma, iPhone 12 was double the price. Switching after 3 years, I wanted a phone fresh in the market.4 MI XI: MI is for masses and I wouldn't buy a premium phone from this brand.

  I ordered product with great hope, but all were dashed when during the call, words went missing on both sides. As a Caller, i was hearing things partially and the same was happening with the call receiver. We both were hearing things not completely as if we were talking like fill in the blanks. I don't know what to call this technically. But this issue happened even after replacement and I had to finally return the product. Now, I use airtel postpaid and this problem never happened even with my old moto G5S plus & doesn't happen till now. Unfortunately, it kept on happening with one plus 9R.

  Phone turns hot even without playing games,  watching content, or even using camera! Oxygen OS feels a tone-downed version of those available in lower OnePlus devices, with no Oxygen Messenger, Dialer, etc. Also, OnePlus treats you with ads (reminders) for Red Cable membership every time you open settings.Honestly it has no special features or terrific performance that would make it distinct from phones available under 30K.

  Buy this phone only if you want a OnePlus phone(fanboy/fangirl) or are a fan of Oxygen OS.Other than that,the device is overpriced and the camera quality is very basic and takes the beat from phones available at a lower price.Main issue is only two 5G bands. Also this can't be fixed with OTA updates due to limited hardware(affirmed by OnePlus in an official statement).Processor is the same 865 rebranded with very slight clockspeed increase on a single core.Battery is good,really good.65W charge is one of the best in it's league. A top competitor in battery.Good build quality.Decent speakers(Dolby stereo).Decent haptics.If the cons don't bother you and you just need a premium phone for basic use,then go for it(though this argument doesn't make sense since it's waste of money and you can buy a good mid range phone instead).Additional info-Want a gaming phone in the budget in neighborhood of 9R? Buy iQOO 7 Legend instead. A really balanced phone except the FunTouch OS which I ain't fan of. Also don't go for OnePlus 9 as it's useless device(especially the Indian variant). Have money enough to buy a premium flagship,then buy OnePlus 9 Pro 5G.Want a phone with multiple features,flagship performance and balanced,go for Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G(only con is old SoC 865).That's it. Have a good day. Out.

  Most awaited phone given such a worst experience..Pros - Nice build quality & very handy phone. Super Processor performance.Super speed Charging..Cons - Worst camera quality for such price range product i must say.. Camera quality cant meet that expectation for a Oneplus lover. Speaker Sound quality - Horrible vibration for the phone once the volume hits the maximum bar..!!! Never expect this from Oneplus..!@ Amazon -Shows 7 days replacement : Complaint raised & Technician support offered , but that was beyond the replacement day policy. So they havent done anything.Called Oneplus. They Offered service at home through Oneplus Care app. But while login , no service available.Again called the service people & they said to visit nearby authorized service dealer & ensured store is open. But when i reach there , it was also closed.Dear Oneplus - Pls take that zero rating from a oneplus brand loved person.....!

  Edit (28-Jul-2021)... The phone has Google dialer (not OnePlus Dialer). So those who record calls regularly be forewarned that Google Dialer makes an announcement at the beginning and end of recording that is heard by both persons (the dialer person and the person who made the call). The only workaround is to sideload the OnePlus dialer but then it has to be manually updated if and when there's a new update.I was in 2 minds after reading a lot of negative reviews here as well as on YouTube (particularly about the camera), but I am completely satisfied with the phone overall (including the camera).1. Great fast changing (from 0 to full well under 45 minutes)2. Good looks3. Comfortable to hold and operate4. Does not heat up significantly either on charging or on playing games (COD)5. Excellent gameplay6. Beautiful display (even in daylight)7. Speaker is loud and clear8. Awesome gaming mode9. Oxygen OS üíú10. Battery lasts one and a half days with moderate use.

  If you have a budget of 40000 this is one of the better phone to go for.1.Oxygen OS2.Good built quality3.Good performance4.Good screen5.Very fast charging6.Oneplus brandingThese being a few of the reasons. Even I was confuced after reading a few reviews about the camera and heating issues, but I would say camera is decent and I did not come across any heating issue as such, yes it does get hot after some gaming but the performance remains good. So I would suggest you to go for it.

  Though the other reviews say a wonderful phone, I didn't see it so in the 2 weeks I've been using this.The worst part is OnePlus has limited 5G bands support. Only 2 bands, they thought it could be fixed with Software update but it's hardware issue. They can't fix that in this 9 series. I thought of returning it to get S20 FE but missed the return date by a day. I'll not keep this phone for much longer.Not a great battery backup. Less than 10hr on normal usage of calls and apps without wifi or any gaming. The OS actually takes up a lot of battery. The only positive point is 65W warp charger, charges phone in less than 45 mins.Camera is ok but not upto the mark for a 40K phone. 9R doesn't have the fancy camera setup. The selfies are better than the rear camera and even they are not good.Fingerprint reader lags sometimes. Doesn't read the finger unless I press it hard on the screen.It feels like a 6GB ram phone, not an 8GB one. Didn't see much difference from old iPhone 6S. Could do better in almost all aspects.

  I don't understand the hype at all. It is fast ..fluid .. but the camera is just so horrendous.  Colours are over saturated. And I've tried to adjust display/ advanced display options thinking it may help with colour reproduction in the photos but nothing helps at all. Depth of field is fine but photos are more than just about depth. Especially under artificial lighting Skin tones appear washed out or reddish and my green mask looks grey.. maybe it can be improved with software updates. But as of now in the camera dept. It sucks so bad. Aside from the camera, the phone works well. Fingerprint reader in quick. And I get good battery life after adjusting a few things in settings  I've not experienced any heating even while charging or even while playing a few games or two during charge.

  Writing this review after using the device for 10 days. This is my first One Plus device and it has met the expectations. I have always been an android favoring person over iOS because the customizing that comes to the table and make the usage of the mobile for lively.Software - 4/5 - Clean OS experience but saw few issues while screen refreshing when the mob is on charging mode. This is very minimal and all of the other options are good.Battery - 4/5 - I am not a gamer and a single charge is lasting me for 1 days with calls, Internet browsing. The Wrap charger is awesome with ful charge in 45-50 minutes. Device heats up during charging at times and this is also small issue.Camera - 4/5 - Not a Camera enthusiastic and the Camera works pretty good for a normal users.Call quality and call connections are pretty good.Audio is pretty good and Video is a treat to the eyes with nice display.Cons - Nothing could I find until now but as everyone says 3.5 MM jack should have been there.

  Posting after 2 weeks of usage:I had been perpetually using OnePlus phones since last ~7 years. I have used various models starting from OnePlus 2, till my last phone OnePlus 6. The OnePlus phones never forced me to change, as they never showed up any issues even after 3+ years of continuous usage. I changed the phone just as I got bored with my OnePlus 6 and wanted to upgrade to the latest OS. One Plus I used for the longest time is over 3 years - and it had been working seamlessly.This version has disappointed me a bit. The biggest issue is the phone gets heated up. This had never happened in their previously released models. I mean, nowadays heating happens probably in very cheap phones.Other dislikes1. Finger print and face recognition do not give you a premium experience2. Camera quality is just adequate. I have seen better cameras at half the price in brands like SamsungLikes:1. OnePlus never hangs, so till now no such trouble2. Gesture controls are good. One may take couple of days to get accustomed, but then it becomes handy3. Screen size is good. Every bit is used, no notch on the top (just a round front camera). Removing buttons from the screen bottom (you can rather use gesture controls) gives you the entire screen size for viewing and using the phone.4. Speaker quality is better than the past models5. Battery life is better than previous models at lease till now

  Previously I was using a Oneplus 5 which is gem of a phone. Kind of way ahead of its time and very reasonably priced. Compared to that, this phone is only a slight improvement in performance but price difference did not justify the purchase.Pros :1. Speed2. Screen3. Zero bloatware4. Fast charging.5. Decent camera. Not excellent but not bad either.Cons.1. Way way way overpriced for what is inside the box.2. NO water protection rating.3. Only one band of 5g supported. So it is useless of for 5g communication in most of the cases.4. Not at all satisfied with battery life for this price.5. This issue is not an issue for everyone. I a facing problems with native call recording which was working fine in oneplus 5. They should provide their own dialer instead of using android stock version.

  I was using OP7 before, from that experience I feel 9R is one of the worst phone ever.1.Performance- No doubt SD 870 was fast actually it‚Äôs SD 865++. RAM Management is also good. Manages heavy apps and multitasking easily.2.Battery- it has good amount battery but it drains very fast. Have to charge multiple times in a day.3. 5G Bands- Freaking 1 band and they tell it‚Äôs 5G powered. Well Settled OP4. Camera- No words totally waste lens.5. Display- Superb Display Quality with smooth transition. 120HZ but drains battery quickly.6. Speakers- No words to express Dolby Atmos is fantastic super loud. Some times can feel vibration at back of the phone.7. OS- Very clean OS with similar Stock OS experience. But has some bugs in it.Conclusion- The OP 9R is only worth for 27k not more than that. It‚Äôs just a rebadged 8T to be very frank.Also note you can consider ‚ÄúGoogle Pixel 4a‚Äù which is really a good phone compared to this OP. Yeah it has low specs but it‚Äôs really good.Peace!!!!!

  I don't know what people (who gave less than 3 rating) are complaining so much about. I never faced such issues. It's a total value for money phone. This phone comes from a good brand and gives premium experience. People who are complaining might be having so many expectations or they might have found their old phones better than this. But I'm buying OnePlus for the first time. The phone totally makes sense. People whoever is complaining just suggest a better phone than this at this price range in a good brand. My opinion is this phone doesn't have a great camera. It has a decent one and all other things about this phone are classy. People who want a phone which is VFM at this point of time, just go for this.

  Dislike. Though the performance is a bit good. The battery performance is poor.  Changed 60% in the morning and by 2pm, it reached lower 14%. Heating makes little nervous. while speaking or during watching any movie, the total body is vibrating, this makes us uncomfort. I change over from Samsung to One plus after Amazon review, but no such a comfort like Samsung. Sometimes ear paining when speak continuously over 10 mins.(SAR??). Amazon sells at MRP (44K) by artificially making high review points and the EMI scheme little bit lingering like EMI discount is sucked back through bank interest.

  Posting this Review after using 9R for one month.Pros1. Build quality is awesome.2. If you are in much gaming this phone will satisfy you with performance and battery optimization.3. If you use it heavily like gaming and social networking site it will give you a single day backup easily.4. As Oxygen is the refined version in all Android O.S, so you definately will get the performance boost.5. Double speakers and dolby atmos is awesome.6. 65 watt wrap charger and it can full charge the phone by approx 20-30 mins.Cons1. Camera can be much optimized. Quality can be improved.2. Only a single band is available of 5g network. Hope we will fall into that band.Rest i am using One Plus mobile for first time and i can definately say i choose a good phone.Just an advice, if you are looking for performance go for it.Rating 4/5.

Plz use good quality tempered glass for screen otherwise fingerprint scanner not work properly . conclusion:Best flagship smartphone under 40k definitely go withit .expect who are want good camera , And after new update their no heating issue And especially OnePlus promise 3 years of android os update & 4 years of security patch update it future proof phone. And 1+ brand value üòç note: only one 5G band n78 may be almost all 5g phons have common n78 bands .
